        <p>The Workhorse Group Incorporated is a EV company which primarily produces delivery vans and got lately popular with a rising share price because it was viewed as one of the possible winners of an 8 billion USPS contract to replace old delivery vans.</p>
<p>This contract busted, however I started writing this article before the deal busted - so don&rsquo;t be surprised by the high numbers.</p>
<p>I owned this stock for several years and wanna display my view of the company in this blog post.</p>
<h2 id="the-usps-deal">The USPS Deal<a href="#the-usps-deal" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>WKHS has a bad history with the USPS. E.g. a USPS driver was hurt during a prototype test. This isn&rsquo;t the first USPS Deal on which WKHS had bid, more later on&hellip;</p>
<p>Competition for WKHS is Oshkosh (with Ford) and Karsan. Oshkosh had also offered a EV solution based on the Ford E-Transit.</p>
<p>I thought Oshkosh has a very good chance because they are one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_100_Contractors_of_the_U.S._federal_government">Top 100 Contractors of the U.S. federal government</a>. They have lots of experience while Workhorse never had such big contracts and would need help to produce lots of vehicles in a short time (at WKHS they assembled the vehicles via hand in the past, not automated in a factory)</p>
<p>Oshkosh won the Deal, however the Valuation of this two stocks before that wasn&rsquo;t on par. WKHS was way higher valuated.</p>
<h2 id="the-valuation">The Valuation<a href="#the-valuation" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Would the Workhorse Group have won an 8 billion contract they probably won&rsquo;t be able to produce all new vehicles in one year. But even if they would do that: Oshkosh had more than 8 billion revenue in 2019 and had a market cap of 6,78 billion USD.</p>
<p>Workhorse had at 36,19 USD per stock a market cap of 4,36 billion. So the market cap already was in the area of a company with 8 billion revenue. I don&rsquo;t see any reason why a higher valuation should be justified.</p>
<p>So the valuation already had a winning of the contract and a really big EV bonus priced in. It may be fair compared to other EV companies like Tesla, but it definitely isn&rsquo;t fair if you take good old school value figures.</p>
<h2 id="the-cycle">The Cycle<a href="#the-cycle" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The Workhorse Stock is a Story Stock. This is not the first bid for a USPS Deal from Workhorse and you can see when they did bid on a big contract in the stock price history. Most of the times the big deals bust.</p>
<p>Current CEO Duane Hughes has a media background - perfect for marketing a story and if you read a few of the many short reports you see that this is the way with which the management had made money: Market the Story of the big deal and sell shares.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future<a href="#future" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Dubious YouTube Videos and bad finances should have been a big red flag for every common investor but the EV-Hyped Robinhood Community and Cathie Wood&rsquo;s ARK Invest have pushed this stock without looking too much on the fundamentals and competition.</p>
<p>So at the time of the writing the stock crashed after the announcement of the USPS Oshkosh Deal more than 47 percent to 16 USD.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say for sure if the stock will go up some time in the future again, BUT I am pretty sure if the stock goes up, it will be because some POSSIBLE Deal will get announced again.</p>
<p>Make one thing clear: This wasn&rsquo;t a traditional investment, this was a bet on a single Deal which made the most part of the valuation. That&rsquo;s the reason I sold my shares - I don&rsquo;t wanna make bets, I want to own profitable companies which share part of the profit with me.</p>
<p>If you are in the stock market because of Bets, you probably should reconsider your Strategy. Because busted Stories like this can destroy your portfolio.</p>
