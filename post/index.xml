      <description>A TypeScript Barrel is a way to simplify the importing of multiple exports from a single module.
Imagine you have a module called myModule that has several exports, such as:
export const foo = 1; export const bar = 2; export const baz = 3; To import these exports into another module, you would normally have to write something like this:
import { foo, bar, baz } from &amp;#39;./myModule&amp;#39;; This can get tedious if you have a large number of exports, and it can also make your code less readable.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;A TypeScript Barrel is a way to simplify the importing of multiple exports from a single module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have a module called &lt;code&gt;myModule&lt;/code&gt; that has several exports, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-typescript&#34; data-lang=&#34;typescript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;baz&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To import these exports into another module, you would normally have to write something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-typescript&#34; data-lang=&#34;typescript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;baz&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;./myModule&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can get tedious if you have a large number of exports, and it can also make your code less readable. This is where TypeScript Barrels come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of importing each export individually, you can create a &amp;ldquo;barrel&amp;rdquo; file that re-exports all of the exports from &lt;code&gt;myModule&lt;/code&gt;. This barrel file would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-typescript&#34; data-lang=&#34;typescript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;./myModule&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in any module that wants to import the exports from &lt;code&gt;myModule&lt;/code&gt;, you can simply write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-typescript&#34; data-lang=&#34;typescript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;myModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;./myModule&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will import all of the exports from &lt;code&gt;myModule&lt;/code&gt; into an object called &lt;code&gt;myModule&lt;/code&gt;, which you can then use in your code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-typescript&#34; data-lang=&#34;typescript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;myModule&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;myModule&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;myModule&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;baz&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a barrel file can make your code more concise and easier to read, especially if you have a lot of exports in your module. It also allows you to group your exports together in a logical way, which can make it easier to manage your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to exporting multiple exports from a single module, you can also use barrels to export multiple modules from a single barrel file. For example, you could create a barrel file called &lt;code&gt;myLib&lt;/code&gt; that exports several different modules, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-typescript&#34; data-lang=&#34;typescript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;./module1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;./module2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;./module3&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in any module that wants to import these exports, you can simply write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-typescript&#34; data-lang=&#34;typescript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;myLib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;./myLib&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will import all of the exports from the modules &lt;code&gt;module1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;module2&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;module3&lt;/code&gt; into an object called &lt;code&gt;myLib&lt;/code&gt;, which you can then use in your code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-typescript&#34; data-lang=&#34;typescript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;myLib&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;1.foo&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;myLib&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;2.bar&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;myLib&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;3.baz&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, TypeScript Barrels are a powerful tool for organizing and importing your modules. They can make your code more concise, easier to read, and easier to manage. If you&amp;rsquo;re not already using barrels in your TypeScript code, I highly recommend giving them a try.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why everyone should know KPIs</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/why-everyone-should-know-kpis/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.m5e.de/post/why-everyone-should-know-kpis/</guid>
      <description>Every Investor has to know KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to value Investments. But why did I write that everyone should know them in my title?
Knowing KPIs helps you even if you don&amp;rsquo;t invest any of your money. It helps you e.g. decide which job you should take or which customer you should prefer.
Deciding between Job Offers - an Example Recently, I decided to start freelancing besides working on my own projects.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Every Investor has to know KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to value Investments. But why did I write that everyone should know them in my title?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing KPIs helps you even if you don&amp;rsquo;t invest any of your money. It helps you e.g. decide which job you should take or which customer you should prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deciding-between-job-offers---an-example&#34;&gt;Deciding between Job Offers - an Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I decided to start freelancing besides working on my own projects. I contacted some possible customers and some companies contacted me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Offer sounded interesting, but they seemed to be uncomfortable about the high of my payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I looked the financials of the company up. They made losses in all years which they reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also reminded myself that I gave a similar company a loan multiple years ago, and I still wait for the back payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After summarizing these facts in my mind, I declined the offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-bad-kpis-are-bad-for-you&#34;&gt;Why bad KPIs are bad for you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had taken the job, it could be that the company would lay me off in a few months or years because they don&amp;rsquo;t have the money to pay me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the financials had been stable enough to pay me, they would unlikely give me a raise because why should the CEO give the employees a raise if his own Investment loses money every year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not permanently employed freelancers most likely know customers which don&amp;rsquo;t pay. But this is an Issue which could be prevented if the Freelancers would know the current financial situation of their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bull-markets-make-us-blind&#34;&gt;Bull-markets make us blind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last years, tech companies could make losses every year and still find investors, who gave them more money to burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was partly because debts were cheap. At just 0.1 to 3% interest each year you can pile up debt without it hurting you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock and housing markets went crazy because of this and many companies which made zero profit could continue to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;times-have-changed&#34;&gt;Times have changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, interest rates are rising, and debt repayments are getting more and more expensive. Companies have higher costs to refinance themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debts have to be paid and CEOs will fire people if they need to save money for repayments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons why Elon Musk is firing so many people at Twitter. Twitter loses money every year and it is harder to find Investors which love to see their money burning - so to be successful, Elon has to fire people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-you-can-do&#34;&gt;What you can do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some parts of the world, like Germany or the UK, you can look up the financials of incorporated companies. (See Bundesanzeiger in Germany and the Companies House in the UK)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, you can at least look up the financials of public companies in the SEC EDGAR database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should always prefer a company which actually makes a profit and has a low debt ratio. (Which in turn means, it should have a high equity ratio)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company without any profit shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be your employer or your customer because that kind of company could soon be bankrupt if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t find more Investors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How legit is a NewsWatch TV Feature?</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/how-legit-is-a-newswatch-tv-feature/</link>

      <description>Many founders get Emails from NewsWatch TV saying that they will promote your company on an American Television &amp;ldquo;Morning Show&amp;rdquo;.
I also got a similar Mail for Alphalerts.com and want to explain what you, as a Founder, should think about that.
Firstly, if you get such a Mail, it is likely that you promoted your product on ProductHunt lately. NewsWatch seems to scrape the ProductHunt listings and even the founder of ProductHunt wrote a tweet about it:</description>

&lt;p&gt;I also got a similar Mail for &lt;a href=&#34;https://alphalerts.com/&#34;&gt;Alphalerts.com&lt;/a&gt; and want to explain what you, as a Founder, should think about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, if you get such a Mail, it is likely that you promoted your product on ProductHunt lately. NewsWatch seems to scrape the ProductHunt listings and even the founder of ProductHunt wrote a tweet about it:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;FYI: Ignore NewsWatch TV&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know several makers and founders that have received an email from them offering a feature on their morning show. They’ll schedule a phone call and then ask for your money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s manipulative and unethical.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ryan Hoover (@rrhoover) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1167165005864869890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;August 29, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if you decide to accept the offer, your product will be shown on TV, but not the way you think about it. You know the annoying Infomercials which often come very late or very early in the morning on niche TV senders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NewsWatch TV operates such annoying Infomercials. And they don&amp;rsquo;t feature your product for free, no no! They want money for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.ph/RKTzj&#34;&gt;which paid for it&lt;/a&gt; say the count of visitors didn&amp;rsquo;t really grew much. You can find similar reports on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.indiehackers.com/post/newswatch-wants-to-feature-wicked-templates-on-tv-is-this-legit-3d4d8186b2&#34;&gt;IndieHackers&lt;/a&gt; and other websites.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I run Drone CI for a longer period now with Docker. Because I decided to switch for multiple reasons from Docker to Podman, this setup had to be changed a bit.
In this blog post, I want to cover how to install Podman and how to set up Drone so that it works with Podman.
Installing Podman Install the podman and podman-docker packages. E.g. on a Debian based System:
apt install podman podman-docker If you currently use docker-compose, then you should also install podman-compose:</description>

&lt;p&gt;If you currently use &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt;, then you should also install &lt;code&gt;podman-compose&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip3 install podman-compose
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing Podman, it could be that you will not find docker images. For that, you should add the following lines to &lt;code&gt;/etc/containers/registries.conf&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[registries.search]
registries = [&#39;quay.io&#39;, &#39;docker.io&#39;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;configuring-drone-ci&#34;&gt;Configuring Drone CI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drone CI uses a mapping of the Docker Socket. This mapping has to be changed so that Drone CI thinks that Podman is our Docker instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to find out where the current podman socket is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;systemctl status podman.socket
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, something like &lt;code&gt;/run/podman/podman.sock&lt;/code&gt; should be written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, with docker-compose, I had to change volumes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;volumes:
    - &#39;/run/podman/podman.sock:/var/run/docker.sock&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you start Drone from the CLI, a config could look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo podman run -d \
    -e DRONE_RPC_PROTO=&amp;quot;https&amp;quot; \
    -e DRONE_RPC_HOST=&amp;quot;YOURDOMAIN&amp;quot; \
    -e DRONE_RPC_SECRET=&amp;quot;YOUR_SECRET&amp;quot; \
    -e DRONE_RUNNER_CAPACITY=2 \
    -e DRONE_RUNNER_NAME=&amp;quot;NAME&amp;quot; \
    --restart always \
    --name runner \
    -v /run/podman/podman.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    docker.io/drone/drone-runner-docker
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it. Obviously you have to enable and start the services, but running Drone with Podman is easier than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Linux: Setup ZITADEL with PostgreSQL</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/linux-setup-zitadel-with-postgresql/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.m5e.de/post/linux-setup-zitadel-with-postgresql/</guid>
      <description>In this Guide, I want to cover installing ZITADEL with PostgreSQL on a Linux system. Please be aware that PostgreSQL support is still in Beta at the time of this writing, and you will need a PostgreSQL installation with Version 14 or higher.
NGINX Proxy Create a new subdomain and point it to your server. Use certbot -d domain.name for creating a new SSL Cert. Create a new file in /etc/nginx/sites-available/domainname</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;In this Guide, I want to cover installing ZITADEL with PostgreSQL on a Linux system. Please be aware that PostgreSQL support is still in Beta at the time of this writing, and you will need a PostgreSQL installation with Version 14 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nginx-proxy&#34;&gt;NGINX Proxy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new subdomain and point it to your server. Use &lt;code&gt;certbot -d domain.name&lt;/code&gt; for creating a new SSL Cert. Create a new file in &lt;code&gt;/etc/nginx/sites-available/domainname&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;server {
    server_name domain.com;

    listen 443 ssl;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/privkey.pem;
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

    location / {
        grpc_pass grpc://localhost:8080;
        grpc_set_header Host $host:$server_port;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;postgresql&#34;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need a database for the software. This can be created by the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo -u postgres psql
postgres=# create database zitadel;
postgres=# create user zitadel with encrypted password &#39;mypass&#39;;
postgres=# grant all privileges on database zitadel to zitadel;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;config-file&#34;&gt;Config File&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often create directories for software in &lt;code&gt;/opt/projectname&lt;/code&gt;. Then a &lt;code&gt;config.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExternalSecure: true
ExternalDomain: &#39;domain.name&#39;
ExternalPort: 443

Database:
    postgres:
        Host: localhost
        Port: 5432
        Database: zitadel
        MaxOpenConns: 25
        MaxConnLifetime: 1h
        MaxConnIdleTime: 5m
        Options:
        User:
            Username: zitadel
            Password: zitadel
            SSL:
                Mode: disable
                RootCert:
                Cert:
                Key:
        Admin:
            Username: postgres
            Password: postgres
            SSL:
                Mode: disable
                RootCert:
                Cert:
                Key:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should also create an &lt;code&gt;init.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;FirstInstance:
    Org:
        Human:
        # use the loginname root@zitadel.localhost
        Username: &#39;root&#39;
        Password: &#39;RootPassword1!&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the following command to download and install Zitadel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;LATEST=$(curl -i https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/latest | grep location: | cut -d &#39;/&#39; -f 8 | tr -d &#39;\r&#39;); wget -qO-  https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/download/$LATEST/zitadel_Linux_$(uname -m).tar.gz  | tar -xz zitadel &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo mv zitadel /usr/local/bin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;masterkey&#34;&gt;Masterkey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should generate and save an masterkey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo &amp;quot;$(tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 &amp;lt;/dev/urandom | head -c 32)&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;start&#34;&gt;Start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;zitadel start-from-init \
    --config /opt/zitadel/config.yaml \
    --steps /opt/zitadel/init.yaml \
    --masterkey &amp;quot;${ZITADEL_MASTERKEY}&amp;quot; \
    --tlsMode external
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now visit &lt;code&gt;https://domain.name/ui/console&lt;/code&gt; and you can log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your custom username and password don&amp;rsquo;t work, then try out the default account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;username: &lt;code&gt;root@zitadel.localhost&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;zitadel-admin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;password: &lt;code&gt;RootPassword1!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, you can start it with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;zitadel start \
    --config /opt/zitadel/config.yaml \
    --masterkey &amp;quot;${ZITADEL_MASTERKEY}&amp;quot; \
    --tlsMode external
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;systemd-daemon&#34;&gt;Systemd Daemon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also set up a custom systemd daemon. For that, create a new file in &lt;code&gt;/etc/systemd/system&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Unit]

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was it. Surprisingly easy. The ZITADEL team is also really fast responding to problems. I had some issues with the beta software, and all of these issues were fixed after a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was even mentioned by their company account:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Source Authentication Solutions</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/open-source-authentication-solutions/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.m5e.de/post/open-source-authentication-solutions/</guid>
      <description>Imagine you run a company and provide multiple web applications for your customers. In the beginning, you probably created a user table and the authentication methods yourself, but from the second application onwards, you will think about using already made open source solutions.
That&amp;rsquo;s the situation I am in right now. I run multiple web applications, which each have their own auth mechanisms and user tables. This means, a user from App1 can&amp;rsquo;t use App2 unless he creates a new account.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you run a company and provide multiple web applications for your customers. In the beginning, you probably created a user table and the authentication methods yourself, but from the second application onwards, you will think about using already made open source solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the situation I am in right now. I run multiple web applications, which each have their own auth mechanisms and user tables. This means, a user from App1 can&amp;rsquo;t use App2 unless he creates a new account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;oauth&#34;&gt;OAuth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I proceed, let&amp;rsquo;s have a short look how OAuth works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OAuth Clients: That&amp;rsquo;s your typical web application which offers a login via 3rd parties like Google and Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OAuth Servers / Providers: That is an identity provider like e.g. Google or Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you add OAuth to your app, most of the time you just add a OAuth client. That means, customers can log in with existing accounts from other services like Google or Facebook. But they can&amp;rsquo;t use their account at your app for logging into other apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you provide a OAuth server, customers can log in into your applications and also login into 3rd party applications via the API of your identity server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-oauth-means-in-my-case&#34;&gt;What OAuth means in my case&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I would just add OAuth client functionality to my apps, then users could use e.g. their Google Account for all my apps, but my apps wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be connected with each other. Every single app would be displayed as 3rd party on the Google website, and every single app would need to authenticate with Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I want to provide one login for all Apps (single sign-on - SSO), just adding a OAuth client like most apps do, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need a OAuth server which provides one single identity and one single login to all my apps. This means, all my apps become OAuth clients of my own OAuth server and my OAuth server itself is e.g. a OAuth client for other OAuth servers like Google.
That way, a user could log in into my OAuth server with his existing Google Account and then continue to use all my apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the theory, now let&amp;rsquo;s look at the realization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;backend-as-a-service-baas&#34;&gt;Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the modern world, solutions like Supabase, PocketBase, Firebase, Appwrite or Parse Server are getting used more and more. One of the reasons is because they handle authentication for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is just one big catch: Nearly all the BaaS solutions are just OAuth Clients! Every single application which you create on them will get their own user table and additionally, you often can&amp;rsquo;t connect custom OAuth Servers but only the popular ones like Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub,&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my problem wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be solved, because I would still have different user tables and separate login processes. So every single app would be displayed on the Google website as a different OAuth client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;openid-connect--oauth2-servers&#34;&gt;OpenID Connect / OAuth2 Servers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have already heard of applications like Keycloak, Ory Hydra, ZITADEL and SuperTokens. These are all auth providers which basically allow you to become some Identity provider like Google yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be, that you already run a OAuth2 server without knowing it. E.g. Gitea has such a functionality built-in. I configured my Gitea instance to act as a OAuth server for e.g. my continuous integration and project management applications. I recently also found out, that my ERP Systems would also support auth via OAuth2, so I could set up all the apps inside my company to work just with the Gitea user auth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you set up an identity server like ZITADEL, then you have to integrate it into all your apps which may be time-consuming in the beginning, but it is absolutely rewarding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will never have to create a user table again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Login isn&amp;rsquo;t different for every app, but handled by one service only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If users are logged into your main provider, then all your client applications don&amp;rsquo;t need the user to enter username and password again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern auth servers support passwordless auth like FaceID, TouchID or Windows Hello&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit more information about such services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;keycloak&#34;&gt;Keycloak&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the oldest and most famous auth servers. Complicated and written in Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ory-hydra&#34;&gt;Ory Hydra&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern, written in Go but still complicated in my opinion (Ory provides multiple packages for their auth solutions and it is hard to figure out which of them you need and how to configure them)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;zitadel&#34;&gt;ZITADEL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern, written in GoLang and in my opinion the one which is easiest to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;supertokens&#34;&gt;SuperTokens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another open source auth server written in Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I began exploring open source authentication solutions, I was thinking maybe some BaaS platform would help me. After figuring out what I wanted, it was clear that Backend-as-a-Service providers aren&amp;rsquo;t a solution for me and I had to look at a completely different kind of software category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know which kind of OAuth2 Server I will stick with over the long time, but I am sure that I will use them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;p&gt;As a Startup founder, marketing is one of the biggest topics you have to take care of. There are tons of marketing automation tools, and most of them aren&amp;rsquo;t cheap.
I found several open source social media management tools, of which some of them are getting used by me for multiple years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;socioboard&#34;&gt;Socioboard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/socioboard/Socioboard-5.0&#34;&gt;Socioboard&lt;/a&gt; is your full-blown social media management tool. It is open source and offers all the features you know from paid tools like Buffer, Hootsuite and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schedule posting, use Content-Libraries, manage multiple accounts, use analytics for checking out your target audience,&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested it yet, and the installation progress is complicated. Besides that, one of the Developers &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/socioboard/Socioboard-5.0/issues/399&#34;&gt;says it is unusable&lt;/a&gt; and created an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vaughngx4/OpenSMM&#34;&gt;alternative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;feed2tweet&#34;&gt;feed2tweet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/chaica/feed2tweet&#34;&gt;feed2tweet&lt;/a&gt; is a small open source python package which allows you to post content from your RSS feed automatically to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use it since multiple years, but I had to fix some issues which aren&amp;rsquo;t merged at the time of writing. So you should better checkout the PR section and maybe install my fork instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;feed2toot&#34;&gt;feed2toot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/chaica/feed2toot&#34;&gt;feed2toot&lt;/a&gt; is from the same author like feed2tweet. It offers posting RSS feed content to Mastodon instead of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the developer merged my PRs and everything should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pod-feeder&#34;&gt;pod-feeder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/brianodonnell/pod_feeder_v2&#34;&gt;pod-feeder&lt;/a&gt; is also an open source tool which makes automatically posting RSS feed content to Diaspora easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure how many people actively use Diaspora, so maybe that&amp;rsquo;s not so important to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;zapier-ifttt-dlvrit&#34;&gt;Zapier, IFTTT, dlvr.it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not open source, but I use the free plan from Zapier for automatically publishing the blog posts from this blog to Medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dlvr.it and IFTTT also offer free plans and can be used for publishing content from an RSS feed to a social media network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some open source tools out there. In combination with free plans from different social media automation companies, you can basically build your social media marketing tool stack for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;feed2tweet, feed2toot and pod-feeder are all written in python. So it should be possible to create one python package for automating the publishing process to Twitter, Mastodon and Diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;2018&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Doubled&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Company should be worth more now.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also invested, via loan, in three - not public - companies which already exist for a longer period and which I don&amp;rsquo;t classify as a Startup because of that. Of these 3 companies, only one could pay me back in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;recap&#34;&gt;Recap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invested into 8 startups and only 4 of them are worth more now. But they haven&amp;rsquo;t gone up 10 times, no! They don&amp;rsquo;t even cover my losses yet. My investments in other private companies were also bad. Of my three investments in mid-sized traditional companies, only one could pay me back in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I add other investments in the private sector - like real estate investment - then it also looks bad because some of the projects failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startup investing via equity crowdfunding is a bad idea after my experiences. Even other kinds of equity crowdfunding are a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad thing is: If you think about it, it makes total sense. Most of the Startups searching for money via equity crowdfunding wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get a loan from a traditional bank, that&amp;rsquo;s why they are using alternative founding methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My profits from the stock market, in comparison, allowed me at the same time to focus on building my own company. So investing in publicly traded companies gave me profits which are not comparable to my losses in Startup investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think as a normal person, you can think about investing in publicly traded companies but should stay away from Startups and let venture capitalists handle that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>VR and digital Assistants are the Future</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/vr-and-digital-assistants/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.m5e.de/post/vr-and-digital-assistants/</guid>
      <description>I want to make a prediction. I think in around 10 - 15 years, most of the people in the western World will own or think about owning a Virtual Reality Headset. I also think that digital Assistants like Google Assistant or Alexa will be more important in that context than currently.
For context: I own a VR Headset and use digital Assistants since multiple years. I also worked in a team developing a digital Assistant and seeing practical use-cases for AR in the past.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I want to make a prediction. I think in around 10 - 15 years, most of the people in the western World will own or think about owning a Virtual Reality Headset. I also think that digital Assistants like Google Assistant or Alexa will be more important in that context than currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context: I own a VR Headset and use digital Assistants since multiple years. I also worked in a team developing a digital Assistant and seeing practical use-cases for AR in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practical-use-cases&#34;&gt;Practical Use-Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write this text on a workstation with 4 displays. This amount of displays is useful for my kind of software development at &lt;a href=&#34;https://chapati.systems/&#34;&gt;Chapati Systems GmbH&lt;/a&gt;. One monitor is used for my IDE, another for rendering the preview of my software, the third one for emails / chats and the last one for a Terminal interface and e.g. checking out Logfiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of setup is not uncommon in software development or trading. Many people can work more efficiently with multiple monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But such a setup has many flaws. Beginning with portability. I travel a lot since the last year. E.g. my girlfriend lives in another city and business fares, political party meetups or other events are not in my small rural village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it would be really cool, having multiple monitors by my side independently of where I am currently. That&amp;rsquo;s hard with physical monitors. In the past, I could only use my 13-inch display from my MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now thanks to Software like &lt;a href=&#34;https://immersed.com/&#34;&gt;Immersed&lt;/a&gt; some people already use multiple virtual monitors which they can take with them wherever they are. There are Stories like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/hours-working-vr-tips/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/immersedteam/working-from-orbit-39bf95a6d385&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; where Users tell their experience of working inside a virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of Setup has many advantages. Because you have 360 degree view inside of a VR Headset, you can basically place as many virtual monitors as physical possible. Independently of your current location. Much cheaper than physical displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why doesn&amp;rsquo;t everybody use them already?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;current-issues&#34;&gt;Current Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While current Generation Headsets have a quite good resolution on paper, the reality is that it is still not sharp enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to divide the resolution by two because you have two eyes, also it&amp;rsquo;s not comparable to traditional displays because instead of a fixed inch resolution, you have a 360 degree view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means with a Meta Quest 2, you can see every single Pixel! Also, the refresh rate is way more important in a VR Headset. Low refresh rates can lead to VR sickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_sickness&#34;&gt;Virtual reality sickness&lt;/a&gt; also happened to me when I tried to move around SkyrimVR with the traditional Game-Style movement. Since I switched to teleportation as movement, it&amp;rsquo;s way better.
When everything is moving around you without your legs moving, that&amp;rsquo;s sometimes too much for your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the sharpness is a big Issue because obviously you don&amp;rsquo;t want to look at a blurry display all day. Besides this, it is very important that your face is positioned in the best way inside of your headset. A small change in the centering of your face can lead to a significant change in the sharpness of the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a good fitting Head Strap, current headsets are too blurry, and you won&amp;rsquo;t use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were issues related to the sharpness. But there is another Issue. Most current headsets need an external PC with a good CPU and GPU for more intensive tasks like e.g. playing SkyrimVR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;outlook&#34;&gt;Outlook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simulavr.com/&#34;&gt;SimulaVR&lt;/a&gt; offers a Headset which has way more computing power than e.g. a Meta Quest 2 and therefore is the first headset I know of where you don&amp;rsquo;t need an external device for playing compute-intensive Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SimulaVR is very interesting, because they also &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SimulaVR/Simula&#34;&gt;open-sourced&lt;/a&gt; their Linux VR Desktop which allows using multiple screens inside of your VR headset. This project seems to provide sharper text than other solutions. There are also some open-source efforts of other people like &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xrdesktop/xrdesktop&#34;&gt;xrdesktop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/letoram/safespaces&#34;&gt;safespaces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention SimulaVR because this Startup already offers what I think is the future: Powerful standalone VR Headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is said to develop a VR or AR headset since multiple years. Apple just changed the way the world thinks about ARM processors. Think what these powerful and energy-saving CPUs could do inside a VR headset. Current Generation devices run out of battery power in just a few hours and have Issues with computing-power. A powerful Apple CPU could solve these Issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook just renamed itself to Meta, which means, telling the world that they want to focus on AR and VR environments. I think these two companies could lead the VR world in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-role-of-virtual-assistants&#34;&gt;The Role of virtual Assistants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are in a 360 degree virtual World, controlling things becomes very important. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to use your Quest controllers for writing text, so some Software allows you to map your physical keyboard and use it while you are e.g. writing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But using Controllers or Keyboards is not natural. Meta itself offers a way of detecting your hands, but it still has some Issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way of controlling things would be voice. Because VR means you don&amp;rsquo;t see your surroundings all the time like with AR, I think that voice will be very important. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to tell your Google Home what should be done compared to navigate with your controllers to the right settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of being in a virtual World, everything looks different in that world, you feel like being e.g. on another planet. So navigating by telling some virtual Butler feels similar to telling a Butler in the real world what should be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigation by Voice is just comfortable and easier than the Alternatives in many cases. Especially in VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VR has currently many Issues but offers many benefits and has likely a bright future in a few years when most Issues are solved. It currently sounds utopian and strange to people not familiar to the matter, but I think that VR together with voice will provide a more natural way of controlling your PC compared to keyboard, mice and touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of possibilities for companies in that space. 360-degree videos are currently a niche space, but what if that space growths fast over the next years? Using Software in 360 degrees requires rethinking, similar to the way Smartphones changed Software Development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;App Stores on VR Headsets are not so filled right now. I think there are chances in that area right now, similar to the early iPhone days. Especially because most people and developers are focusing on the gaming space, while all other kinds of Software will also be used on VR Headsets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Communism doesn&#39;t work</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/why-communism-doesnt-work/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.m5e.de/post/why-communism-doesnt-work/</guid>
      <description>Modern Communists are hard to argue with. Mostly because they say things like &amp;ldquo;There never was a real communist country&amp;rdquo;. So it&amp;rsquo;s hard to take real world examples, because they say countries like the Soviet Union, German Democratic Republic, Cuba or China &amp;ldquo;never were truly communist&amp;rdquo;.
But I argue there can never be a &amp;ldquo;truly communist&amp;rdquo; country. Why? Because it is impossible to create that after my opinion. So if you are open for different opinions, then continue reading.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Modern Communists are hard to argue with. Mostly because they say things like &amp;ldquo;There never was a real communist country&amp;rdquo;. So it&amp;rsquo;s hard to take real world examples, because they say countries like the Soviet Union, German Democratic Republic, Cuba or China &amp;ldquo;never were truly communist&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I argue there can never be a &amp;ldquo;truly communist&amp;rdquo; country. Why? Because it is impossible to create that after my opinion. So if you are open for different opinions, then continue reading. I will explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;desires-of-humans&#34;&gt;Desires of Humans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can describe the problem with Communism, we have to understand what motivates people and what people desire. That also explains why people are successful in Capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A normal human being has desires like traveling the world, owning a house and, more importantly, be healthy, be able to eat and drink every day, have a family.
All these things need Resources and other people have to work for you (e.g. creating bricks for your house, building the house, planting grains) for fulfilling these dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people also don&amp;rsquo;t want to work hard until they die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dream-world&#34;&gt;Dream World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communists want to live in a nice house, eat good food and drinks, and don&amp;rsquo;t want to work too long. But there is a Problem: Even in the modern world, we don&amp;rsquo;t have the productivity and neither the resources to let everybody own a house, eat great food and be happy every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for fulfilling these dreams, the world actually would need to be more productive, which in turn would mean working harder and longer for everybody. But then, in turn, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have the time to actually enjoy these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-catch&#34;&gt;The Catch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the modern world, if you understand how the system works, you have many ways of earning enough money for fulfilling these dreams. So there is a way for you to have a better life than the average Joe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people who find ways to have a better life than other people are not wanted in a Communist world. So there is a need for a ruling party which enforces the rules and prevents people to gain more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a Communist world can never be a free world for everyone because the people who want to have more are not allowed to do so. That&amp;rsquo;s why all ruling parties in Communist countries are so strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ruling parties, however, have more power than the rest of the Society. So that&amp;rsquo;s basically the paradox of Communism. Communism doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be a two class system, but it has to be because otherwise the basic Idea of Communism can&amp;rsquo;t be enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;human-nature&#34;&gt;Human Nature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, some people who believe in Communism think that they would be in the ruling party. I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. Why? Because the people who are successful in Capitalism are not successful because they love Capitalism so much, no! They are successful because they learn how the System works and do everything which is needed for gaining more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a communist World, these successful Capitalist people would do everything for learning how the systems works and how they can get into the ruling party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after my opinion, most people who believe in Communism today would be victims of the system in a communist World and some people who are successful in Capitalism today would be the Rulers of the Communist System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, after all, this world is neither about Communist nor Capitalist Ideologies. This World is about people who have desires. Some people are ready to do everything for fulfilling these and others just dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anarchism&#34;&gt;Anarchism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people now might come and say Anarchism is somehow connected with Communism, but that&amp;rsquo;s bullshit. When there is no Authority, everybody can do what they want. So some people can just steal things and gain more than others. That&amp;rsquo;s neither Communism nor Capitalism, it&amp;rsquo;s its own kind of System.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Reason why Linux Gaming is so limited</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/the-reason-why-linux-gaming-is-so-limited/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.m5e.de/post/the-reason-why-linux-gaming-is-so-limited/</guid>
      <description>Ever tried Gaming on a Linux system? Even though Linux exists since more than 30 years now, it is still hard to play a Game on it. Most Games don&amp;rsquo;t even publish a release for Linux. That&amp;rsquo;s why projects like Wine exist (Wine provides a compatibility layer so that Linux Users can play Windows Games)
Why is it like that? For that, we need to understand how a Game works and how a Game Developer thinks.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Ever tried Gaming on a Linux system? Even though Linux exists since more than 30 years now, it is still hard to play a Game on it. Most Games don&amp;rsquo;t even publish a release for Linux. That&amp;rsquo;s why projects like Wine exist (Wine provides a compatibility layer so that Linux Users can play Windows Games)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-it-like-that&#34;&gt;Why is it like that?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that, we need to understand how a Game works and how a Game Developer thinks. Game Developer need to earn money so that they can buy e.g. food. For that, targeting a big Group of Customers is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a Game Developer writes a Game, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to write separate Code for every GPU / CPU. In the early days of computing (e.g. the C64 and Atari days), this was the case. Back then, developer wrote code for every different GPU and CPU. This is very time-consuming and if Companies would still act like that, we would have to wait even longer for the e.g. next GTA 6 Game or the next Elder Scrolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Companies like Microsoft and Silicon Graphics came. These companies did something really great for all Game Developers. They provided APIs which can be accessed by one Interface and which handle the different GPUs for you.
This means, a Game Developer only has to write the code once and these APIs handle the rest. Now publishing a Game for different computers is easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This APIs are named DirectX (from Microsoft) and OpenGL. Because DirectX is from Microsoft, the API was only available for Windows. OpenGL on the other hand is available for a wide range of Operating Systems.
OpenGL is also Open Source which means every developer can take a look at the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you can think logical, you already found the reason why Linux Gaming is so limited. The question about the Availability of Games is a Question about which API is more successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people use Windows. Microsoft provides DirectX for Game Development, so most Game Developers choose DirectX as API platform because they can reach most of the people by that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If OpenGL would be more successful, then we would have more Games for Linux because OpenGL is compatible with Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future&#34;&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, Game Developers used OpenGL because they could target Windows, Linux and macOS. Apple however, decided to deprecate OpenGL APIs on all of their platforms because they now have their own proprietary &amp;ldquo;Metal&amp;rdquo; API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many features (like Ray tracing) are only available in these proprietary APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So probably many developers will still choose proprietary APIs like DirectX or Metal in the future because they provide better features which result in better Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason behind this is that companies like Microsoft and Apple want that. They earn way more money that way. Developers have to pay fees and if they use a Windows-only or Apple-only API, then this will result into exclusive titles which are only available on one platform and customers will choose the platform with the better exclusive titles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Scapegoat called Meta</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/the-scapegoat-called-meta/</link>

      <description>Many people hate Facebook and Instagram. They say it makes us feel bad, is bad for our health, increases the suicide rate of teens and does many more bad things.
But is Meta really all the bad in this world, or is it maybe that Meta just offers a Tool, and it depends how people use it?
I want to shine a light on the later part in this article.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Many people hate Facebook and Instagram. They say it makes us feel bad, is bad for our health, increases the suicide rate of teens and does many more bad things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is Meta really all the bad in this world, or is it maybe that Meta just offers a Tool, and it depends how people use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to shine a light on the later part in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;instagram&#34;&gt;Instagram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about rising suicide rates in teens because of wrong beauty standards, it&amp;rsquo;s not that Meta tells us &amp;ldquo;use Instagram to post pictures of your body, so that other people can rate it&amp;rdquo;. Meta just offers a platform, and it is up to you how you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mostly use Instagram as a backup for my holiday pictures and to share nice places with other people. And that&amp;rsquo;s the thing! The first picture on Instagram was a picture of a Harbor. So the initial thought what Instagram should have been was more near to my usage of it and not to the world-wide beauty competition many teens see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the issues all the people blame Instagram for is nothing created by Instagram themselves but more what the Society made of it. In my eyes, that tells us more what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with our Society and not what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facebook&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again. People blame Facebook because there are many evil and stupid people on Facebook who use it to promote extremist political views and other things bad in our Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook also gets blamed because it &amp;ldquo;doesn&amp;rsquo;t do enough&amp;rdquo; against crime in some countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But put yourself into the position of Mark Zuckerberg. You created a Tool which was meant for people to keep in contact. Now people all over the world use it in languages you don&amp;rsquo;t understand and in Countries where it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even make sense to operate because nearly no companies spend money for advertisement there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very hard to keep up with all the laws and regulations in all the countries in this world. And countries / societies have different views on what is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So forcing a American view on countries in the Middle East could be very dangerous for employees there. Mark Zuckerberg could maybe make some people in the Western world happy, but other people would be so angry that employees may be killed&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the people in the USA / EU want Facebook to be kind of a &amp;ldquo;World Super Police&amp;rdquo;. But Facebook is no government Organisation. Facebook is just a company which sells a tool. Simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision what&amp;rsquo;s right and what&amp;rsquo;s wrong still is the job of governments and the solution to these issues is not Facebook becoming a police, it&amp;rsquo;s more figuring out how Facebook and local governments can work together to create a safer platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a big part of the Issues people have with products from Meta are actually issues of our society, and they use Meta as a Scapegoat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Killing / harming Meta won&amp;rsquo;t make the world a better place because the Issue is in our Society. Instagram-Teens don&amp;rsquo;t have problems with Meta, they have problems because of the wrong beauty standards our Society has. Political problems are nothing new and weren&amp;rsquo;t created by Facebook, but people hate Meta because their products show them these Issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s comparable like hating a weapon company because people die. The weapon company doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually kill the people, but they offer tools which could do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally hate this mentality of hating a Tool instead of actually focusing on the real problem. The real problem in our world aren&amp;rsquo;t the tools, but the people who use them for bad.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Investing in Domains</title>

      <description>Since I started creating websites at a young age, I always tried to have good domain names for my projects. I also sold a few - that&amp;rsquo;s why I want to cover this topic today.
A good domain name can be worth quite a bit. Some Domains were sold for multiple millions.
But unfortunately, Investing in Domains isn&amp;rsquo;t quite so easy as you think. I bought at least 45 different domain names and selling them is really hard.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Since I started creating websites at a young age, I always tried to have good domain names for my projects. I also sold a few - that&amp;rsquo;s why I want to cover this topic today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good domain name can be worth quite a bit. Some Domains were sold for multiple millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately, Investing in Domains isn&amp;rsquo;t quite so easy as you think. I bought at least 45 different domain names and selling them is really hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-it-is-hard&#34;&gt;Why it is hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;costs&#34;&gt;Costs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to pay monthly for your domain name. So owning a domain has a certain fix cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much you pay depends on the ending of your domain. Because the Top-level domain (TLD), which is the last part of your domain name, is normally operated by a company. This company can decide how much a registration costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not the only cost. Normally, you don&amp;rsquo;t buy your domain directly from the TLD operator. You buy them from a registry, which itself is a customer of the TLD operator.
This registry also has costs and wants to make a profit, so they obviously ask for a higher price than they pay the operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(BTW: Operating such a TLD is also not such a great business - I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.m5e.de/post/analyzing-the-profitability-of-gtld-registry-operators/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about that too)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;selling-it&#34;&gt;Selling it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, I only sold two domains. During a period of more than a decade domain ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think it is self explaining that I don&amp;rsquo;t buy domain names for selling, but because I need them for my own project ideas and my company. In total, owing the domains has cost me more than I earned from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to sell a domain. I had multiple offers from people who contacted me directly. That means they found e.g. my Twitter handle or my email address and send me a message asking if I would be willing to sell the domain to them. Some of them even wanted to buy whole projects from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other way of selling domains is using specialized Websites like sedo.com, dan.com, Domain Forums, Facebook Groups or even the registries themselves (Namecheap offers customers also to sell their domains on the Namecheap marketplace for example)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did both ways and unfortunately even if you use a marketplace which promotes your domain name it&amp;rsquo;s very hard because not every customer is interested in all domains - they search for a specific domain fitting their business, and you have to have the luck of encountering the customer who actually needs your domain name for his business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-it-worth-it&#34;&gt;Is it worth it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of the people: No!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of having a domain name is in most cases more expensive than the potential profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies have specialized in reselling domain names (Tucows Inc. is one of the most popular examples). But most of these specialists also try to earn money with Advertisements on the domain names and with Economies of Scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They usually get a ton of domain names way cheaper than normal customers and also have way more data about which domain names have a higher chance to be bought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is a hard market, and the average John Doe should only buy a domain name for this own usage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cost of Political Party Membership in the EU</title>

      <description>When I was a kid, I completely ignored politicians and thought they were unnecessary. Now, I understand they are here to represent the people and try to prevent that different groups inside our society kill each other by defining the rules of how our communities work.
I am interested to bring my thoughts into this by joining a political party. There are big differences in how much such a membership costs in a country, but even bigger ones when you compare political parties from different countries.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I am interested to bring my thoughts into this by joining a political party. There are big differences in how much such a membership costs in a country, but even bigger ones when you compare political parties from different countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I want to show these differences by comparing different parties inside the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party. We will assume that our possible member earns around 4k per Month and is 27 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;118 EUR*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Demokratesch Partei&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;25 EUR&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lithuania&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Liberalų sąjūdis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10 EUR&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Italy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;More Europe&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50 EUR&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hungary&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Momentum Mozgalom&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;31.56 EUR (1000 HUF per Month)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Belgium&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Open Vld&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12.5 EUR&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{*} There is a big difference in the Netherlands for people below or above the age of 27. Below the age of 27, the membership costs are only 35 EUR per year. Also, the first two years only cost 25 EUR per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting: Not many countries make the membership cost dependent on the salary. Here in Germany that is common for all popular parties, but in most of Europe you pay a fixed price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This table doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain all the political parties in the ALDE Party because e.g. it isn&amp;rsquo;t super easy to get the information about the yearly fees from some political parties and I also had problems with translating sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you can definitely see that the cheapest parties (e.g. from Belgium, Lithuania, Estonia and Sweden) only ask for around 12.5 to 15 EUR per year while the most expensive ones in e.g. Germany, Spain and the Netherlands are above 100 and sometimes even above 200 EUR per year.
Most of the parties seem to be in the range between 10 and 90 EUR which is still cheap compared to the costs in my country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am quite sad that German political parties decided to make it expensive for their members to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SolarWinds Stock Analysis</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/solarwinds-stock-analysis/</link>

      <description>When the SolarWinds supply chain attack happened in 2020, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get deep into what SolarWinds does because I had to focus on day-to-day business. But now, in 2022, I found out what SolarWinds does because I was searching for monitoring solutions myself.
In this article I want to cover the current valuation, a description of what SolarWinds does and my thoughts about the future.
Valuation As of March 12, the company trades at 11.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;When the SolarWinds supply chain attack happened in 2020, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get deep into what SolarWinds does because I had to focus on day-to-day business. But now, in 2022, I found out what SolarWinds does because I was searching for monitoring solutions myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I want to cover the current valuation, a description of what SolarWinds does and my thoughts about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation&#34;&gt;Valuation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of March 12, the company trades at 11.21 USD per share. That&amp;rsquo;s below book value. The company has an equity ratio of nearly 48% and the revenue for 2021 fell nearly 30% from 2020 and is now at 2017 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies stock fell nearly 70% in the last few years. So seeing that the book value is higher and the revenue didn&amp;rsquo;t fall as much as the stock price, this seems like an overreaction connected with the hack. But to understand the hack better, let&amp;rsquo;s see what SolarWinds does on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solarwinds-business&#34;&gt;SolarWinds Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At it&amp;rsquo;s core, SolarWinds offers IT monitoring solutions. IT professionals may know competitors like PRTG from Paessler AG or Nagios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These solutions make it easier to control IT infrastructure like Servers, Routers, Switches and more. The goal is to detect a possible problem before an outage happens. So an engineer may get a push notification if e.g. the storage level on a server gets low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One very big difference to its competitors is that SolarWinds offers a wide range of monitoring solutions. While most competitors focus on special areas - like collecting and analyzing log files or monitoring servers and routers, SolarWinds offers solutions for nearly every area.
SolarWinds archived that by buying smaller companies like e.g. Loggly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical customer company has many sensors which collect data and send it to the monitoring dashboard. Because a lot of information can be monitored, these Sensors are in very high numbers (often a company has more sensors than employees)
Think about an international corporation - sensors may be grouped into the different sites around the world and may monitor every single IT device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a company wants to switch to another solution from SolarWinds, not only the dashboards, but also every single sensor will most likely need work to be replaced by the new solution. Also, because most competitors only cover some of SolarWinds areas, the switching company will need to make new contracts with multiple new companies.
All-in-all, switching from SolarWinds is hard and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free, Open Source Solutions exist (I for myself want to use only free software for monitoring my upcoming SaaS company) but again - you have to setup and connect multiple Software Solutions - there is no single one which can easily replace all of SolarWinds features.
For this setup of the Open Source solutions, a lot of time and manpower is required - so it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me if running SolarWinds is cheaper for big companies than paying all the employees who work on integrating the Open Source Systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hack&#34;&gt;The Hack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because SolarWinds monitors so many systems of its customers, this hack has gained so much media attention. To prevent outages, you really have to know a lot of details of your infrastructure, and the attackers could get deep inside this information about SolarWinds customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the hack was a supply chain attack originated from the build system which SolarWinds uses. This is very interesting to me because I am aware, that many of the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest tech companies have had similar vulnerabilities in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent example could be &lt;a href=&#34;https://thehackerblog.com/zero-days-without-incident-compromising-angular-via-expired-npm-publisher-email-domains-7kZplW4x/&#34;&gt;this case&lt;/a&gt;, where a hacker could push malicious code into the Angular framework from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s not like this couldn&amp;rsquo;t happen to some of the most well known companies. SolarWinds was probably chosen for the attack because it&amp;rsquo;s monitoring solutions are deeply integrated into the US Government and the biggest American Companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for SolarWinds, the hack was a PR disaster. The CEO blamed an intern about an easy password, and that&amp;rsquo;s a no-go from a marketing perspective.
(Because first of all, an intern shouldn&amp;rsquo;t get so much responsibility and second of all, there should be processes to prevent easy to guess passwords)
But to be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that most companies are better than that. This could have happened at nearly every company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;future&#34;&gt;Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SolarWinds customers are deeply integrated into a system which is not easy to replace. So it&amp;rsquo;s hard to know how many of these companies spend the money for switching to a different solution because of this hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, such a hack could happen again at a competitor. SolarWinds has a forward P/E of 12.79, the competitor Datadog has a forward P/E of 322.58. That&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous in my eyes, because the same could happen to Datadog and then the revenue could also fall instead of growing high numbers every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe customers will forget the hack in a few years, but maybe the Image to too damaged and SolarWinds has to rename it&amp;rsquo;s business, spin off all the assets or find another solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not investment advice or a buy/sell recommendation. This is my personal opinion and is for information and entertainment purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone acts independently with their financial decision and bears responsibility for it themselves. Trading in securities is always subject to risks and can lead to total loss or debt (e.g. in the case of warrants). Liability is excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influence of Sanctions on Economies</title>

      <description>The current events in Ukraine led to many economic sanctions against Russia. Despite this war is the result of leaders, not their citizens, the West decided to define many very hard sanctions which resulted into making it impossible to trade with Russian Stocks right now. (After the close of the Moscow Exchange, ADRs listed in the US and GDRs listed on the London Stock Exchange also can&amp;rsquo;t be bought anymore)</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;The current &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.m5e.de/post/the-russian-ukrainian-conflict-and-the-stock-market/&#34;&gt;events in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; led to many economic sanctions against Russia. Despite this war is the result of leaders, not their citizens, the West decided to define many very hard sanctions which resulted into making it impossible to trade with Russian Stocks right now. (After the close of the Moscow Exchange, ADRs listed in the US and GDRs listed on the London Stock Exchange also can&amp;rsquo;t be bought anymore)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because many Russian stocks can only be sold right now, the prices for these fell more and more. Speculators who bought some stocks in the beginning of this Week could get these shares very cheap on the few Exchanges and Brokers which still traded them, but now these Speculators also can&amp;rsquo;t trade Russian stocks anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in this blog post I want to answer the question if these dramatic price deductions are in any relation to the various results of sanctions in recent human history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sanctions-against-japan&#34;&gt;Sanctions against Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second world war was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCD_line&#34;&gt;ABCD line&lt;/a&gt; in which America, Britain, China, and the Dutch stopped selling iron ore, steel and oil to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Japan found a way of producing 80% of the Oil which was imported by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sanctions-against-iran&#34;&gt;Sanctions against Iran&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran is the only country which I know of that has faced similar sanctions like Russia currently. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.m5e.de/post/alternatives-to-swift/&#34;&gt;SWIFT-Ban&lt;/a&gt; is nothing new to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinda similar like Japan, Iran started to produce a lot more of which was imported previously by themselves. This seem to be a good strategy. The Iranian Economy actually grew despite the Sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important thing to note here is that western investors don&amp;rsquo;t have a easy way to invest in Iranian stocks. So if Russia would face a similar evolvement, then the Russian economy could grow in a few years above the previous levels, but maybe western shareholders will see nothing of this because the Sanctions make it impossible to invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;statistics&#34;&gt;Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a good article out there from which I quoted:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Despite their widespread use on the international stage, economic sanctions are largely ineffective in achieving their objectives [...] between 1915 and 2006, comprehensive sanctions were successful, at best, just 30 percent of the time.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/O5sUbT6VY3&#34;&gt;https://t.co/O5sUbT6VY3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Christoph Miksche (@CMiksche) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CMiksche/status/1499665643246919680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;March 4, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistically and by looking at previous examples we can find out that Capitalism and Economy is stronger than political Sanctions. Most countries can grow economically even when the biggest powers in this world don&amp;rsquo;t like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for foreign Investors, Sanctions can make it very hard and destroy their investment. E.g. in Russia only a few percent of the population use Credit cards, so the impact on companies like Visa and Mastercard is probably bigger then the worries of most Russians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you look from a foreign Investors perspective, then the question is not if Russia will grow again (thats very likely), it is if your country or the Exchanges you use allow you to invest in Russia - that&amp;rsquo;s the bigger Issue for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to note that I am not trying to defend Russia or any other country mentioned here - in all examples there was a good reason to sanction the mentioned countries but from a rational perspective a sanction will most likely improve the local economy so that it is not so vulnerable from outside influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not investment advice or a buy/sell recommendation. This is my personal opinion and is for information and entertainment purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone acts independently with their financial decision and bears responsibility for it themselves. Trading in securities is always subject to risks and can lead to total loss or debt (e.g. in the case of warrants). Liability is excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alternatives to SWIFT</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/alternatives-to-swift/</link>

      <description>In all the recent news to the War between Russia and Ukraine, I always ask myself about the economic consequences.
Recently the EU and US declared a ban of SWIFT currently focused on the state owned banks (which are also the biggest banks in Russia).
What&amp;rsquo;s SWIFT exactly? Before getting into possible alternatives to SWIFT, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into what the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication is.
It is an Organization with HQ in Belgium which defines Standards and Services for the transaction of financial information.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;In all the recent news to the War between Russia and Ukraine, I always ask myself about the economic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently the EU and US declared a &lt;a href=&#34;https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-russia-ukraine-invasion-swift-ban-sanctions-7792865/&#34;&gt;ban of SWIFT&lt;/a&gt; currently focused on the state owned banks (which are also the biggest banks in Russia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-swift-exactly&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s SWIFT exactly?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting into possible alternatives to SWIFT, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into what the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an Organization with HQ in Belgium which defines Standards and Services for the transaction of financial information. For that it has its own Network, the SWIFTNet. Data is transferred as XML-Files (I personally would prefer JSON, but old ppl like XML) and the Software is based on Java (again, I would prefer something like Go or Rust, but however old people love Java).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIFT#U.S._government_involvement&#34;&gt;CIA listened&lt;/a&gt; to many SWIFT transactions and there was even a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack&#34;&gt;series of hacks&lt;/a&gt; by the hacker group APT 38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most financial transactions in this world use SWIFT when the goal is to transfer money into another country. So transactions inside a country like Russia are untouched by a SWIFT ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alternatives&#34;&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;international-banks&#34;&gt;International Banks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many very big banks have branches in multiple countries. That means they don&amp;rsquo;t need SWIFT because they are sending money internally from e.g. the Citibank office in Russia to the Citibank office in the US over their own infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;spfs&#34;&gt;SPFS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian equivalent of the SWIFT, called System for Transfer of Financial Messages. Basically was developed because the west already threatened Russia with the SWIFT ban a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is getting more and more active, especially over the last few years. Even some international banks like German Deutsche Bank are said to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cips&#34;&gt;CIPS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same idea, but the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System is from China. Seem to be mostly important for RMB transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sfms&#34;&gt;SFMS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India also developed a standard called the Structured Financial Messaging System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stablecoins--cryptocurrencies&#34;&gt;Stablecoins / Cryptocurrencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While SWIFT, SPFS, CIPS and SFMS are standards controlled by countries, Stablecoins are asset-backed Cryptocurrencies which are backed by e.g. fiat money like the USD. The big advantage here is that you can&amp;rsquo;t ban or sanction a decentralized system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while it is hard for Russian Citizens or Companies to buy USD, they could simply buy a Stablecoin which has the same value and can be sent to everywhere around the world. However the Russian Government is also critical about Cryptocurrencies, so this is something which will become more popular by citizens who buy Stablecoins in private, unknown by the Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Russian population is creative, then there are tons of ways to sent money around the world and maybe this sanction will result into a promotion of alternative payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Russian-Ukrainian War and the Stock Market</title>

      <description>In 2008 Russia fought against Georgia in the Russo-Georgian War. This resulted into a catastrophic situation for the people which live in the areas occupied by Russia. Still today, Russia claims that parts of Georgia are &amp;ldquo;independent&amp;rdquo; Countries which do not belong to Georgia.
So why do I start with this story? It&amp;rsquo;s simply because yesterday Putin officially announced to marsh into Ukraine and basically has the same strategy: he says parts of Ukraine are &amp;ldquo;independent&amp;rdquo; Countries which need to be free from Ukraine.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;In 2008 Russia fought against Georgia in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War&#34;&gt;Russo-Georgian War&lt;/a&gt;. This resulted into a catastrophic situation for the people which live in the areas occupied by Russia. Still today, Russia claims that parts of Georgia are &amp;ldquo;independent&amp;rdquo; Countries which do not belong to Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do I start with this story? It&amp;rsquo;s simply because yesterday Putin officially announced to marsh into Ukraine and basically has the same strategy: he says parts of Ukraine are &amp;ldquo;independent&amp;rdquo; Countries which need to be free from Ukraine. That is basically the same Strategy Putin uses for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primarily interest here is to find out how it will affect the stock market. The best way to make predictions about the future is to look in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2008 the West (EU and US) were concerned but did nothing because they feared a war. If you look completely rational on that, it would mean that you could use drops in the Russian stock market to invest and make a profit in a few years or months&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However: This time it already resulted in consequences: Germany just froze the Nord Stream 2 Project of Gazprom. It is important to note here that Gazprom made big deals with China in recent years - so that could soften the situation of Gazprom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden wanted to remove Russia from Visa, Mastercard and SWIFT, but he got criticisms and other important ppl said it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be that easy to remove Russia from SWIFT, so currently this is just words without consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have Stocks around the world and think that if the playbook is similar with the Geogrian Situation, then the Russian stock market will drop a little bit for the next few years and then go back to its normal evolvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only real big thing which could change that would be if the West really kicks Russia out of SWIFT, fights Russia and maybe even delists Russian stocks (American Depositary Receipts) on the US Exchanges, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen in 2008, back then the conflict happened with a Bush Administration.
I am not a U.S. politics expert but if a Republican Politician doesn&amp;rsquo;t start a war in a similar situation, why should a Democratic Politician do that? Aren&amp;rsquo;t they usually the ones which gain votes by saying they are against wars?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how should you proceed? If you trade short term, then you can probably get some profit by shortening the Russian stock market. If you invest long term, then you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t think that this will affect Russian companies on the long-term - it didn&amp;rsquo;t in similar situations a few years back so the way international politics work would have to be changed first before it will really have a long-term impact on the Russian stock market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you should think about if it is morally acceptable to invest in Russia. That&amp;rsquo;s probably why Russian stocks were so undervalued over the last years: Ppl didn&amp;rsquo;t want to invest in a country ruled by Putin but on the other side ppl who didn&amp;rsquo;t care about moral aspects could make big returns and profit from high dividend yields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I found out that Russia already has two alternatives to SWIFT: The SPFS &amp;ldquo;System for Transfer of Financial Messages&amp;rdquo; is basically a SWIFT clone from Russia and the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) is the equivalent from China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia is a Cash focused country, so the ban of MasterCard and VISA would probably hurt these American Companies more than the Russian economy. Quote: &amp;ldquo;Approximately ten percent of payment cards issued in Russia were credit cards&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.statista.com/statistics/1099452/credit-card-and-debit-card-number-in-russia/#:~:text=Approximately%20ten%20percent%20of%20payment,250%20million%20of%20these%20cards.&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not investment advice or a buy/sell recommendation. This is my personal opinion and is for information and entertainment purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone acts independently with their financial decision and bears responsibility for it themselves. Trading in securities is always subject to risks and can lead to total loss or debt (e.g. in the case of warrants). Liability is excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, Florian Gallwitz explained that there are no &amp;ldquo;Social Bots&amp;rdquo; which are often covered in newspapers and magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newspapers and Journalists create stories about AIs which post about political discussions but in reality these &amp;ldquo;Social Bots&amp;rdquo; are just accounts from human beings which write a lot of social media posts, classified as bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real existing &amp;ldquo;bots&amp;rdquo; are dumb systems which e.g. post blog posts on Twitter (I use systems like that for publishing my content across different social media channels) and you feel if you write with a human being or not, because chatbots aren&amp;rsquo;t that evolved yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seem to exist ppl who post propaganda, but these are people, not bots!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes complete sense - if you think about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an AI would be that much evolved, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the inventor of this the richest human being on earth? The biggest companies like Google, Microsoft and Apple are trying to automate as much as possible for years and invent tools like GitHub Copilot so that writing Code can be partially done by AIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For creating an AI which seems to react like a human in different situations, you would need a ton of training, very much computing power and lots of people who train the AI every day. It would cost a ton of money, more than you could imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would you use that for political propaganda in one country if you could basically rule the world? Companies would pay you tons of money because such a system could replace so many people, thus make the company more efficient and more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that newspapers use automated systems for writing news about the stock market or the weather since years, however between writing a simple text and replying to users is a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people unfortunately just read headlines and don&amp;rsquo;t think about it - this is just one of many great talks given on the rC3 2021, there was also a great talk about fairy tales which the west tells itself about Asia (like the Chinese social credit system): &lt;a href=&#34;https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-2021-xhain-354-painting-tech-dystopi&#34;&gt;https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-2021-xhain-354-painting-tech-dystopi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Over the last days Evergrande China, the 2nd largest property developer in China after revenue, was in all financial news. More than 1.5 million homes are planned by Evergrande and it has $300 billion in liabilities.
There are fears that Evergrande China will cause another financial crisis like in 2008, comparable to the Lehman Brothers insolvency. I am watching this very carefully. Most of my personal Assets are stocks and a big decline in the stock market could mean damage comparable of loosing multiple yearly incomes to me.</description>

&lt;p&gt;There are fears that Evergrande China will cause another financial crisis like in 2008, comparable to the Lehman Brothers insolvency. I am watching this very carefully. Most of my personal Assets are stocks and a big decline in the stock market could mean damage comparable of loosing multiple yearly incomes to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Seems like that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Evergrande?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#Evergrande&lt;/a&gt; problem already affects the financial markets…&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Christoph Miksche (@CMiksche) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CMiksche/status/1439953316340015104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they company fails to pay the liabilities it could cause a systematic insolvency because the banks wouldn&amp;rsquo;t the get money and the market would be flooded with very cheap homes which could cause insolvency of other property developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem would affect China first because western banks don&amp;rsquo;t have a big share in the 300 billion - mostly Chinese banks gave the money but if there would be a systematic failure in China the rest of the world would feel that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most countries have strong trade relationships with China - e.g. the German Car industry sells most of the Cars in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not only real damage, fears of that situation already caused a decline in nearly every stock market index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-solution-opinion-of-experts&#34;&gt;The Solution (Opinion of Experts)&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;As far as I understand it most experts believe the chinese government will support the competition to takeover parts of Evergrande and solve the problem that way without a crisis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If that doesn&amp;#39;t happen we could have a Lehman moment.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Christoph Miksche (@CMiksche) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CMiksche/status/1440249711051427844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Experts think this will be solved like Long-Term Capital Management. To make it short: in the LTCM case, the competition took over parts of the business and the government supported it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-thoughts&#34;&gt;My Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Over the last months the chinese goverment destroed whole sectors (e.g. E-Learning) without any help - so I wouldn&amp;#39;t bet on support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also the company already tried to sell parts without much success and the competiton already has high debts...&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Christoph Miksche (@CMiksche) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CMiksche/status/1440249732756959241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution which the Experts share has two assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government is interested to help solving the issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competition can take over parts from Evergrande&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have very high doubts that this assumptions are correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 1: In the last months, China created rules which destroyed whole sectors. E.g. they destroyed the whole E-Learning sector. It is basically forbidden to sell E-Learning services. So it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like the top priority of the government would be supporting financial markets or companies. It looks more like it is more important to them that the government is stronger than companies. Letting financial markets fail could cause a big financial trouble but it actually could be in the favor of the politicians who want a strong government and weak companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western &amp;ldquo;Experts&amp;rdquo; make the assumptions China would act like a capitalist nation, but China isn&amp;rsquo;t the US. So we can&amp;rsquo;t expect they make the same decisions as we would make. They have different interests and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 2: The competition has also debts. I am not sure if they are strong enough to take over such a big transaction. Remember: more than 1.5 million homes and 300 billion liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not investment advice or a buy/sell recommendation. This is my personal opinion and is for information and entertainment purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone acts independently with their financial decision and bears responsibility for it themselves. Trading in securities is always subject to risks and can lead to total loss or debt (e.g. in the case of warrants). Liability is excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I write my Journal</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/how-i-write-my-journal/</link>

      <description>Recently I came across a blog post which described some Tips how to write a Journal on Hacker News.
This interested me because I also write a Journal since multiple years (since the 20th March of 2018 to be precise and if we don&amp;rsquo;t count my Journals I had as a child) and it already helped me in multiple occasions.
The author of the article asked himself multiple questions every day and because I think that is too much pressure I want to describe how I do it.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Recently I came &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28530120&#34;&gt;across&lt;/a&gt; a blog post which described some Tips how to write a Journal on Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interested me because I also write a Journal since multiple years (since the 20th March of 2018 to be precise and if we don&amp;rsquo;t count my Journals I had as a child) and it already helped me in multiple occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author of the article asked himself multiple questions every day and because I think that is too much pressure I want to describe how I do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-it-can-be-helpful&#34;&gt;Why it can be helpful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some possible use cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search when you bought an Item and find out if it still has warranty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find out which stock you bought at which price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When was the trip with your girlfriend again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did your business grew so successful?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What did you do back on &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize: If you keep track of your daily life you can look up everything even if you don&amp;rsquo;t remember something anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-write-it&#34;&gt;How I write it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted something simple which will last till I die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a software developer, I use tools like Git for versioning files and Markdown for writing documents (this blog post itself is also written as a Markdown document). Additionally to that, I already had a wiki which was realized as a bunch of Markdown documents and folders in a Git repository hosted on a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I used my existing wiki, added a new folder &amp;ldquo;Journal&amp;rdquo; and inside that a folder for the year. That directory contained files named after each month - &amp;ldquo;03.md&amp;rdquo; for example - which had a title for every day and bullet points for every thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple system exists till this day with a small change that I moved it from my Raspberry Pi to my self-hosted Gitea instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-personal-finance-is-connected-with-that&#34;&gt;Why personal finance is connected with that&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this year I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/beancount/beancount/&#34;&gt;beancount&lt;/a&gt; to track all my finances in a very similar approach: Files have a special syntax with lines for every transaction and that files get tracked in a Git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the parsable syntax you can create reports of your finances (like income and expenses) thus have a better overview of where your money flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I trade with stocks since 2014 my journal was heavily used for tracking stock transactions which helped me a lot but obviously such a bookkeeping computer language is a way better solution for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you bought a stock but because your Depot was moved to another broker, you don&amp;rsquo;t see the value anymore at which you bought. Now you would have to search old documents of that transaction to find out at which price you can sell to make a profit. In some similar cases this personal tracking of my finances helped me a lot and I would recommend every stock trader writing down the transactions with a system like beancount.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Difference between Wirecard and Steinhoff</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/the-difference-between-wirecard-and-steinhoff/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>Wirecard and Steinhoff are both companies of German origin which had accounting scandals. In this post I want to describe why these two accounting scandals are completely different and why I choose to take a long position in Steinhoff after the scandal, although I did make a profit with a short position in Wirecard.
I am writing this article because I want to describe that shorting a stock with an accounting scandal / fraud isn&amp;rsquo;t always the best option.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Wirecard and Steinhoff are both companies of German origin which had accounting scandals. In this post I want to describe why these two accounting scandals are completely different and why I choose to take a long position in Steinhoff after the scandal, although I did make a profit with a short position in Wirecard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this article because I want to describe that shorting a stock with an accounting scandal / fraud isn&amp;rsquo;t always the best option. Sometimes this can be a chance for a long position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-wirecard-scandal&#34;&gt;The Wirecard Scandal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirecard is a German payment processor and financial services provider. It was higher valued than any German Bank and viewed as very successful by many German Investors because of a growing revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020 it was reported in an audit that €1.9 billion were &amp;ldquo;missing&amp;rdquo;. I shorted Wirecard after the announcement because it meant that the majority of Wirecards revenue didn&amp;rsquo;t exist while there were multiple billion Euro of credit from banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that there was a way higher debt to the creditors than actual revenue or profit which could pay for the credit, so there was no real way that Wirecard could save itself from insolvency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Wirecard is a payments provider used by companies — which company does trust a payment provider which manipulates balance sheets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-steinhoff-scandal&#34;&gt;The Steinhoff Scandal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steinhoff International is an international retail holding company. Before the scandal it was the second-biggest furniture company in the World after IKEA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically the scandal which took off in 2017 was that Steinhoff manipulated transactions worth of $7.36 billion from the years 2009 to 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes one important part: The revenue alone in 2017 was nearly 19 billion Euro!!! Even if you subtract all manipulated transactions from that there is still value!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steinhoff also is a holding company which holds many different companies which can be sold. That&amp;rsquo;s what happened after the scandal: Many subsidiaries were sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-difference&#34;&gt;The Difference&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the financial side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wirecard made up most of the revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steinhoff didn&amp;rsquo;t made up most, but part of the revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the strategic side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wirecard was basically one company which hadn&amp;rsquo;t much to sell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steinhoff had many companies with actual real estate and products — many things to sell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-opinion&#34;&gt;My Opinion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought Steinhoff shares after the scandal because I estimated that after selling some of the subsidiaries there would be enough money for paying the creditors and restructuring the company.
That process is still ongoing and Steinhoff still exists. Why? Because they simply had more value and the manipulations were in an area where it was possible to pay them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shorted Wirecard because there was noting to hope. With basically all revenue made up there is no real revenue which could help paying the credits down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should look at the actual numbers after an accounting scandal. I also know there were investigations about an accounting issue at GE, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see it effecting the share price too much — because the numbers in question were too small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting all accounting scandals into the same bucket is wrong, but I experienced that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To be honest I was laughing my ass off because there are German finance influencers which always talked bad about Investors in Steinhoff but then were heavily invested in Wirecard, didn&amp;rsquo;t see that scandal coming and even invested after there were many signs that the balance sheet was faked)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not investment advice or a buy/sell recommendation. This is my personal opinion and is for information and entertainment purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone acts independently with their financial decision and bears responsibility for it themselves. Trading in securities is always subject to risks and can lead to total loss or debt (e.g. in the case of warrants). Liability is excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Problem with Odoo</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/the-problem-with-odoo/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.m5e.de/post/the-problem-with-odoo/</guid>
      <description>The history with Odoo started with TinyERP / OpenERP which was a free ERP System. This was a great idea and pioneered the open source ERP environment.
But in the last years the name and the vision changed. Now Odoo provides besides the ERP part also a CRM, CMS, Blogs, Forums, E-commerce (Online-Shops), Timesheet, Project Management, Inventory Management, Recruitment, Spreadsheet, Documents, Email Marketing&amp;hellip;
So in short: Odoo changed from a focus on ERP to an all-in-one solution which seems to cover nearly every application a business needs.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;The history with Odoo started with TinyERP / OpenERP which was a free ERP System. This was a great idea and pioneered the open source ERP environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the last years the name and the vision changed. Now Odoo provides besides the ERP part also a CRM, CMS, Blogs, Forums, E-commerce (Online-Shops), Timesheet, Project Management, Inventory Management, Recruitment, Spreadsheet, Documents, Email Marketing&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in short: Odoo changed from a focus on ERP to an all-in-one solution which seems to cover nearly every application a business needs. And the bad part is Odoo got money from investors for this stupid idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-had-the-same-idea&#34;&gt;I had the same idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I call this idea bullshit I wanna note that I developed an application with the exact same Idea in the past. I didn&amp;rsquo;t finish my work, but basically I started with an CMS in PHP and had the idea to extend it to ERP and various other applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason I stopped working on my idea was because I found out that Odoo was ahead of me (when I started my project, Odoo was still called OpenERP, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware that Odoo just had begun to realize my dream)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other reason I stopped was because I changed my mind. I worked as a software developer with many ERP, CRM and other business applications back then and created custom software which was connected to this type of software systems. So I had experience with this type of programs and common problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-odoo-wants-to-solve&#34;&gt;The problem Odoo wants to solve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the problem Odoo and I wanted to solve is the same: Offer one solution for different kind of business software - because traditionally e.g. ERP Systems had no APIs - so as a software developer you had to hack your way to connect e.g. the e-commerce shop with the ERP systems.
This often meant you read or write data directly to the database of the ERP system because the ERP system has no API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if the systems offered an API: This still meant that you have to create a custom piece of software to connect the different systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An all-in-one solution means the data is in the same system - no more costly manual connection making and if you use the UI, then it&amp;rsquo;s also faster to switch to the other business program - e.g. switch from ERP System to Online-Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On paper this sounds great: only maintenance one program, only train the employees in one system. Many benefits&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;its-not-so-hard-anymore&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not so hard anymore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today more and more ERP Systems and other kind of business applications offer an API. So the connecting part is cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is software like data mapping tools which make it possible to connect different APIs without any coding experience, additionally to that we live in a world where open source (free) software from all over the world is available and we have software stores which offer plugins and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you have a common type of connection (maybe something like connecting SAP and Magento or WooCommerce), then there is a high chance that out of the shelf software can solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-reason-this-is-the-wrong-way&#34;&gt;The reason this is the wrong way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The all-in-one solution means that Odoo can&amp;rsquo;t focus on one type of application. They need to split up into different teams for different types of applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes - Odoo has grown and got investor money, so they have many employees and many open source developers BUT they aren&amp;rsquo;t offering only a free ERP System anymore. Even this focus on one part of the business software world was hard and most businesses today don&amp;rsquo;t know Odoo - so they weren&amp;rsquo;t that successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players like SAP, Intuit and Infor dominate the ERP market. This was the old competitor landscape. Through the new applications, Odoo now competes additionally to that to Microsoft, Salesforce, Amazon, Magento, Atlassian, MailChimp,&amp;hellip; Basically now the whole business software industry is the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you really think that Odoo can beat the whole software business industry? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so - especially because I already found and fixed a bug in the German version of the Online-Store Module. It&amp;rsquo;s simply not possible for one company to offer the best product for different parts of business software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a reason that Salesforce is so big in CRM and SAP so big in ERP - there is also a reason why you use a dedicated Online-Store software which is made by another company than your ERP System. Different companies are good in their own specialties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this broad range of software, Odoo loses focus and that means losing quality. The bigger the range of products, the more worse is the quality and the more impossible it will be for Odoo to offer the best software in each category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is true in the whole business world - it&amp;rsquo;s the reason we have different companies, but somehow Odoo has still found its way to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-new-approach&#34;&gt;My new approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said, I had the same idea. But currently I have only ideas for some types of business software. I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna create an All-In-One solution because I know it would take forever to even offer a bad experience in all types of business software and big companies already excel in some parts of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many IT companies around the world simply exist because they are needed to connect this different kinds of business applications and most of them create custom solutions every time.
I think it would make more sense to offer out of the shelf solutions for connecting these systems and some companies already make this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Open Source ERP System still would be my choice for a business, but I would prefer something like Tryton - Tryton has a focus on the ERP part and a modular software architecture with a great API.
So this would be perfect for connecting other applications to it. (As a sidenote: Tryton was forked out of an Odoo predecessor)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-2022&#34;&gt;Update 2022&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a company this year and despite my conclusions in this blog post, I still decided to try out Odoo as an ERP System for my business. I now want to share some Issues I encountered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly: Without external Software, no automatic tax pre-registration is available here in Germany&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The generated Tax Reports miss data if you don&amp;rsquo;t manually configure the chart of accounts to tax grid relationship. I created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/102104&#34;&gt;GitHub Issue&lt;/a&gt; for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t post the last mentioned issue in the forum because apparently I have no rights even after confirming my email&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could not submit any support ticket. It only displayed, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to re-attach your files if you had any.&amp;rdquo; (This could be because I have no paid Subscription? But they didn&amp;rsquo;t show any message like that)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Analyzing the profitability of gTLD registry operators</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/analyzing-the-profitability-of-gtld-registry-operators/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.m5e.de/post/analyzing-the-profitability-of-gtld-registry-operators/</guid>
      <description>I am a very big DNS nerd and have always registered new domains for my projects before I even made the concept of my new ideas. We had tests about the Domain Name System at my professional school and I can&amp;rsquo;t remember I ever not scored the highest&amp;hellip;
So as someone who currently pays for 33 domains a year of which all are for private projects and none generates money I had an idea for a new gTLD which I wanted to operate.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I am a very big DNS nerd and have always registered new domains for my projects before I even made the concept of my new ideas.
We had tests about the Domain Name System at my professional school and I can&amp;rsquo;t remember I ever not scored the highest&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as someone who currently pays for 33 domains a year of which all are for private projects and none generates money I had an idea for a new gTLD which I wanted to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New generic top-level domains have a high entry barrier. It&amp;rsquo;s expensive (plan about 200k USD alone for the valuation from the ICANN) and you also have high recurring costs - but is it profitable to operate such a TLD?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first gTLD application round closed in April 2012 and some of the first applicants were already founded years before that.
Some of these new operators are public traded companies and others have to report their balance sheet to governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soooo &amp;hellip;. There is data available about those new operators and before I decide if I wanna put such much money on a new TLD I (from an investor perspective) want to know how profitable new gTLDs are.
(As a side note: I am not so rich to operate a new gTLD alone - I would need some support from other investors too ^^)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I am writing this post. I need to validate if an investment in a new gTLD is profitable and if the needed energy pays out.
As a modern investor there are tons of other opportunities which pay dividends, interest and more. So if you invest in something specific you should have a good return and reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;registry-operators&#34;&gt;Registry operators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;donuts&#34;&gt;Donuts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donuts Inc is a private domain name registry with 242 new gTLDs. It is the biggest of the new operators by number of TLD endings. The German Wikipedia page about them was initially written by me on the 15 July of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I haven&amp;rsquo;t found much financial info about their profit, so they can&amp;rsquo;t simply evaluated by me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;minds--machines&#34;&gt;Minds + Machines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are great for a valuation because Minds + Machines Group Limited is a public traded gTLD operator. They weren&amp;rsquo;t profitable for many years, but they were in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the numbers for the Total comprehensive income / (loss) for the year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2013: Loss of 222,029 GBP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2014: Loss of 3,832,128 GBP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2015: Loss of 677,936 GBP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2016: Loss of 2,782,107 GBP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2017: Loss of 84,584 GBP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2018: Loss of 8,836,970 GBP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2019: Income of 932,983 GBP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minds + Machines also published a June 2020 Interim Report which shows a profit. So I hope the long loss period is over. The share price has decreased in the years because of the bad financials&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have taken the chance to buy some shares because if they turned to profit, then the company is undervalued based on the current share price in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dotberlin&#34;&gt;dotBERLIN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dotBERLIN GmbH &amp;amp; Co. KG is the German private operator of &amp;ldquo;.berlin&amp;rdquo;. The fine thing about German companies is that they have to report the balance sheets and you can get old balance sheets from the &amp;ldquo;Bundesanzeiger&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data is not as fresh as from public traded companies, but this analysis is not about fresh data - it&amp;rsquo;s about statistically profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A look at the balance sheet doesn&amp;rsquo;t show us an Income statement, but we can see a &amp;ldquo;Shortfall not covered by equity&amp;rdquo; for the years 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009&amp;hellip; - at that point I just went directly to 2006 and there was also this shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to me, it looks like dotBERLIN wasn&amp;rsquo;t profitable since founding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is investing in gTLD a good thing for the world? Not really. New gTLD require new servers which need electricity which could be produced environmentally harmful whereas you could invest your money in e.g. new electricity sources like solar or wind parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these providers operated very long without any profit. However some of them (like Minds + Machines) are profitable now and I am invested in Minds + Machines because they are cheap (in my opinion) on the stock exchange, considering they are now profitable and operate with a lovely business model (subscription based service which is essential if you have an online-business)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take the decision easy if you wanna start a new gTLD registry. As noted - this kind of business seem to take long until it&amp;rsquo;s profitable and other business models like building a new solar park can be better predictable, faster profitable and are better for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you start a new gTLD, you should expect many years without profit and the need for fresh money from investors. So - it&amp;rsquo;s a bad idea for the most of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not investment advice or a buy/sell recommendation. This is my personal opinion and is for information and entertainment purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone acts independently with their financial decision and bears responsibility for it themselves. Trading in securities is always subject to risks and can lead to total loss or debt (e.g. in the case of warrants). Liability is excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Workhorse Group Story</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/the-workhorse-group-story/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.m5e.de/post/the-workhorse-group-story/</guid>
      <description>The Workhorse Group Incorporated is a EV company which primarily produces delivery vans and got lately popular with a rising share price because it was viewed as one of the possible winners of an 8 billion USPS contract to replace old delivery vans.
This contract busted, however I started writing this article before the deal busted - so don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised by the high numbers.
I owned this stock for several years and wanna display my view of the company in this blog post.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;The Workhorse Group Incorporated is a EV company which primarily produces delivery vans and got lately popular with a rising share price because it was viewed as one of the possible winners of an 8 billion USPS contract to replace old delivery vans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contract busted, however I started writing this article before the deal busted - so don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised by the high numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I owned this stock for several years and wanna display my view of the company in this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-usps-deal&#34;&gt;The USPS Deal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WKHS has a bad history with the USPS. E.g. a USPS driver was hurt during a prototype test. This isn&amp;rsquo;t the first USPS Deal on which WKHS had bid, more later on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition for WKHS is Oshkosh (with Ford) and Karsan. Oshkosh had also offered a EV solution based on the Ford E-Transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought Oshkosh has a very good chance because they are one of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_100_Contractors_of_the_U.S._federal_government&#34;&gt;Top 100 Contractors of the U.S. federal government&lt;/a&gt;. They have lots of experience while Workhorse never had such big contracts and would need help to produce lots of vehicles in a short time (at WKHS they assembled the vehicles via hand in the past, not automated in a factory)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oshkosh won the Deal, however the Valuation of this two stocks before that wasn&amp;rsquo;t on par. WKHS was way higher valuated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-valuation&#34;&gt;The Valuation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would the Workhorse Group have won an 8 billion contract they probably won&amp;rsquo;t be able to produce all new vehicles in one year. But even if they would do that: Oshkosh had more than 8 billion revenue in 2019 and had a market cap of 6,78 billion USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workhorse had at 36,19 USD per stock a market cap of 4,36 billion. So the market cap already was in the area of a company with 8 billion revenue. I don&amp;rsquo;t see any reason why a higher valuation should be justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the valuation already had a winning of the contract and a really big EV bonus priced in. It may be fair compared to other EV companies like Tesla, but it definitely isn&amp;rsquo;t fair if you take good old school value figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cycle&#34;&gt;The Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Workhorse Stock is a Story Stock. This is not the first bid for a USPS Deal from Workhorse and you can see when they did bid on a big contract in the stock price history. Most of the times the big deals bust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current CEO Duane Hughes has a media background - perfect for marketing a story and if you read a few of the many short reports you see that this is the way with which the management had made money: Market the Story of the big deal and sell shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;future&#34;&gt;Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubious YouTube Videos and bad finances should have been a big red flag for every common investor but the EV-Hyped Robinhood Community and Cathie Wood&amp;rsquo;s ARK Invest have pushed this stock without looking too much on the fundamentals and competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at the time of the writing the stock crashed after the announcement of the USPS Oshkosh Deal more than 47 percent to 16 USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t say for sure if the stock will go up some time in the future again, BUT I am pretty sure if the stock goes up, it will be because some POSSIBLE Deal will get announced again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make one thing clear: This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a traditional investment, this was a bet on a single Deal which made the most part of the valuation. That&amp;rsquo;s the reason I sold my shares - I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna make bets, I want to own profitable companies which share part of the profit with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in the stock market because of Bets, you probably should reconsider your Strategy. Because busted Stories like this can destroy your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not investment advice or a buy/sell recommendation. This is my personal opinion and is for information and entertainment purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone acts independently with their financial decision and bears responsibility for it themselves. Trading in securities is always subject to risks and can lead to total loss or debt (e.g. in the case of warrants). Liability is excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not the only risk. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Dating Apps since multiple months (I also made a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.m5e.de/post/fighting-tinderplusplus-malware/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about a problem with Tinder) and I think the market will evolve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enter-the-world-of-facebook&#34;&gt;Enter the World of Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook launched its own Dating service: Facebook Dating&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this will dominate the market in a few years - why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearly all popular Dating Apps use Facebook Data / Login for registration and validation of the user
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook already has data like Profile Photos, Workplace, Interests,&amp;hellip; which are important in the wold of online dating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook already has methods to validate profiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook already has a bigger user base than all of the dating competition
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To me it seems like the user base of Facebook Dating is already bigger than the user base of Bumble in my local area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered no limits in swipes or other things
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All features which are premium on the competition Apps are free on Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered no Ads in Facebook Dating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess this depends on the individual, but I&amp;rsquo;ve got more matches in a few days on Facebook Dating than in multiple months on Bumble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook promotes social connections - you see who is Friends with other Facebook Friends of you on Facebook
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This adds validation - you trust the other side more that it is not a fake profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should users register with Facebook on Third-Party-Apps if Facebook already provides a superior Dating experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently many people don&amp;rsquo;t know about Facebook Dating, but Facebook is a Advertising Platform with a giant user base - so it should be very easy to gain more and more people until the competition dies out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like the Investors in Bumble aren&amp;rsquo;t aware that this big competitor is out there and the IPO money was needed for Bumble to have a chance fighting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not investment advice or a buy/sell recommendation. This is my personal opinion and is for information and entertainment purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone acts independently with their financial decision and bears responsibility for it themselves. Trading in securities is always subject to risks and can lead to total loss or debt (e.g. in the case of warrants). Liability is excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On the 23andMe and VGAC Merger</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/on-the-23andme-and-vgac-merger/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.m5e.de/post/on-the-23andme-and-vgac-merger/</guid>
      <description>On the 4th February 2021 23andMe and VG Acquisition Corp announced that they will merge, bringing 23andMe into the public.
As VGAC is already tradable in the public market, the shares have skyrocketed to 19 USD. But this is crazy&amp;hellip;
Why this is crazy? First you should know that the initiators of a SPAC commonly have additional rights to e.g. buy additional shares. They also mostly pay 10 USD per share.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;On the 4th February 2021 23andMe and VG Acquisition Corp announced that they will merge, bringing 23andMe into the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As VGAC is already tradable in the public market, the shares have skyrocketed to 19 USD. But this is crazy&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-this-is-crazy&#34;&gt;Why this is crazy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you should know that the initiators of a SPAC commonly have additional rights to e.g. buy additional shares. They also mostly pay 10 USD per share. I don&amp;rsquo;t go more into detail here, but I want to talk about the shareholders which buy VGAC at the current 19 USD price WITHOUT additional rights like the initiators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vgacquisition.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/23andMe-Investor-Presentation.pdf&#34;&gt;Investor Presentation&lt;/a&gt; these VGAC shareholders will only get 11 % of the combined company! BUT the market cap of VGAC at 19.05 USD is 876.30 Mn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you buy VGAC at 19 USD you don&amp;rsquo;t get 23andMe at a $3.5 billion valuation like Vigrin and the other investors - Nooo, you buy at a way higher price. 19 USD per VGAC share, 11 % of VGAC go into 23andMe would result into a nearly 8 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it into comparison: At 19 USD per share you nearly buy at a valuation (8 billion) at which the institutional investors bought Ancestry ($4.7 billion) and 23andMe ($3.5 billion) combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: 23andMe had declining revenue in the past years and does only make around 200 million revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You buy a business at a valuation at 8 billion which makes only around 200 million revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to buy 23andMe you should wait till the merger is done because the current VGAC market cap is way too high considering existing VGAC shareholders will only get a little part of the combined company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A alternative investment Idea could be OraSure Technologies Inc - these are the producers of the diagnostic testing kits which are used by 23andMe and Ancestry. Current market cap only 989,83 Mio USD, the sales have declined from 181,74 Mio in 2018 to 154,60 Mio in 2019 but looks like a fair or even cheap valuation to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not investment advice or a buy/sell recommendation. This is my personal opinion and is for information and entertainment purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone acts independently with their financial decision and bears responsibility for it themselves. Trading in securities is always subject to risks and can lead to total loss or debt (e.g. in the case of warrants). Liability is excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Apple environmental friendly?</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/apple-environmental-friendly/</link>

      <description>Why Apple Products aren&amp;rsquo;t as environmentally problematic as many believe. Apple bashing is popular these days. Louis Rossmann, Hugh Jeffreys and others are talking about repair issues on YouTube, Mark Zuckerberg sees Apple as an unfair competitor and Xiaomi mocks Apple for Not Including Charger and then does the same.
So in this world where Apple bashing is popular I wanna tell you my opinion.
I bought my first new Apple Products this year (primarily caused by the impressive performance of the M1), but I already have used used Apple Devices for a longer period.</description>
      <content>&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-apple-products-arent-as-environmentally-problematic-as-many-believe&#34;&gt;Why Apple Products aren&amp;rsquo;t as environmentally problematic as many believe.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple bashing is popular these days. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/rossmanngroup&#34;&gt;Louis Rossmann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/hughydo&#34;&gt;Hugh Jeffreys&lt;/a&gt; and others are talking about repair issues on YouTube, Mark Zuckerberg sees Apple as an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/facebook-ceo-ramps-up-apple-attack-weighs-antitrust-suit&#34;&gt;unfair competitor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gizmodo.com/xiaomi-made-fun-of-apple-for-not-including-charger-in-b-1845954366&#34;&gt;Xiaomi mocks Apple&lt;/a&gt; for Not Including Charger and then does the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in this world where Apple bashing is popular I wanna tell you my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought my first new Apple Products this year (primarily caused by the impressive performance of the M1), but I already have used used Apple Devices for a longer period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am by no means an Apple Fanboy. My main daily drivers where Android, Linux (Arch Linux and Debian) and Windows devices and I will continue to use these devices alongside my new shiny Apple stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides that I am a Xiaomi, Fairphone and Lenovo shareholder and currently no Apple shareholder - so my financial interest is the success of the competition, not the success of Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After clearing my position on Apple as a company I wanna share you why I think Apple is not as environmentally problematic as many blame them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;environmental-friendly&#34;&gt;Environmental friendly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some points which make Apple devices kinda environmental friendly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher price encourages people to use it longer and not replace it as fast as Android smartphones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The high price also lets more people try to repair it than cheap Androids
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the competitors have more expensive replacement parts than a new mobile phone (think of curved displays)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longer lasting software support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smaller battery which uses less resources from the environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smaller range of products - repair shops can concentrate on some products instead of trying to have replacement parts for a really big Android or Windows device world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;problems&#34;&gt;Problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these Problems do not only affect Apple devices, Androids have the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple seem to pair everything - from the TouchID over Display, Camera, even the Battery - and limits replacement parts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only special devices can copy this pairing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It becomes more difficult to open the products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many things like display and battery are glued and need special devices which work with the optimal heat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many parts or schematics which could be used to repair devices aren&amp;rsquo;t even offered by Apple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advantages-over-android&#34;&gt;Advantages over Android&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longer software support (even cool programs like Android One are getting less popular)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android One offers a guaranteed time of getting updates but many hardware partners are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.techradar.com/news/xiaomi-may-have-ditched-the-android-one-program&#34;&gt;moving away&lt;/a&gt; from this program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even with Project Treble which makes it easier to offer Updates for Android devices many OEMs still don&amp;rsquo;t do this over many years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less battery usage (so smaller batteries and less used Lithium) but better performance thanks to a better processor architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less diversify, thus a shorter list of replacement parts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repair knowledge concentration on a smaller list of devices, thus better support against the big Android or Windows world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advantages are often not really intended but a by-product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of Bashing - but Apple has environmental advantages over many other producers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people in social media blame only Apple but the competition is not really better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanna note that if you really have a problem with repairability then you should buy something like a Fairphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT you should know that you can get much more performance for your money from Xiaomi or Apple and you can buy used Xiaomi phones with a better performance than a Fairphone cheaper as some of the Fairphone parts costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have repaired Xiaomi phones in the past, so it is not impossible. Displays for low-end Xiaomi devices do only cost around 20 EUR -  that&amp;rsquo;s 4.5 times cheaper than a Fairphone 3 Display!!! (For the 90 EUR cost of a Fairphone Display you can even get a new phone from Xiaomi)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who buys a expensive product will be more likely to try to repair it than someone who buys a cheap product and unfortunately even companies which were known to offer repairable devices like Lenovo are doing things like soldering more and more RAM onto the Laptop instead of using slots&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comparison of Email Hosting Possibilities</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/comparison-of-email-hosting-possibilities/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.m5e.de/post/comparison-of-email-hosting-possibilities/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve hosted my own Mailserver in various configurations since more than 6 years now. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve taken multiple breaks from hosting it myself and explored other solutions for hosting emails with your own domain names.
Because my own Mailserver has lately problems (downtimes) I wanna explore other possibilities of hosting my email addresses.
So let&amp;rsquo;s take a look&amp;hellip;
Self-hosting (VPS, Tools like Mailcow, Mailu, etc) You simply setup a Mailserver with software like Mailcow, Mailu or Mail-in-a-Box on a virtual Server and manage it yourself.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Because my own Mailserver has lately problems (downtimes) I wanna explore other possibilities of hosting my email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s take a look&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;self-hosting-vps-tools-like-mailcow-mailu-etc&#34;&gt;Self-hosting (VPS, Tools like Mailcow, Mailu, etc)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You simply setup a Mailserver with software like Mailcow, Mailu or Mail-in-a-Box on a virtual Server and manage it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have the control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlimited domains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlimited mailboxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheaper than most alternatives if you don&amp;rsquo;t look at the time you need for setup and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most cheap VPS don&amp;rsquo;t offer a lot of space and if you subtract the OS and installed software, then your space for mail is very limited&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to invest a lot of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need a good spec VPS because Mailserver software and SPAM protection are performance intensive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small VPS are often targeted by criminals and protection isn&amp;rsquo;t very easy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I&amp;rsquo;ve done the most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past this was very straightforward if you know how to setup and secure a mailserver but I&amp;rsquo;ve lately problems with things like DDoS and Brute Force Attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24154524&#34;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; from me on Hacker News was even so heavily voted that it was for a short time on the front page of HN - so this seems to be a problem for other people too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pawnmail&#34;&gt;Pawnmail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This service doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist anymore but I wanna mention it because it was one of the few free providers where you can get mailboxes for your own domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AFAIK that service doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist anymore because it was targeted by spammers and had problems with attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zoho-mail&#34;&gt;Zoho Mail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free plan supports one domain with up to five users and has a 5GB/User and 25MB attachment limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unusable for me because IMAP/ POP/ Active Sync are not included in the free plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian company, the CEO seems to support Hindu nationalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;yandex-mail&#34;&gt;Yandex Mail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest player in my comparison. Offers 10 GB of storage, up to 1000 users and support for custom domains for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like the only problem is that you have to trust a Russian company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mxroute&#34;&gt;MXroute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has various plans for custom Domain Email Hosting. All plans include support for unlimited Domains and unlimited Email Accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially the Black Friday deals seem to be pretty good every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US company, interestingly the Founder has worked for Christian Institutions - so both - the CEOs of Zoho and MXroute seem to be religious persons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mailcheapco&#34;&gt;Mailcheap.co&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheap Hosting Provider for custom Domain Email, comparable to MXroute but it has more bad reviews than MXroute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;migadu&#34;&gt;Migadu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the HN Post to this Article &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25201493&#34;&gt;someone mentioned&lt;/a&gt; Migadu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migadu is the only provider on this comparison from Switzerland and the pricing is more expensive compared to the US providers&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you pay more but your data is probably also more secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;postaleio&#34;&gt;postale.io&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French provider, offers a free plan which includes one domain, 2 mailboxes, 3 aliases and 1 GB per mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it seems like the cheapest hosting possibilities are either trusting a Russian company which government maybe spies on you, trusting a US company which is also obliged to let the government spy on you or to go to an Indian company which is run by a Hindu nationalism supporter&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting your own server isn&amp;rsquo;t the cheapest option but you are more in control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are privacy focused providers like ProtonMail or Fastmail out there but the cost of those services are way higher than the providers I mentioned at the time of this writing. (Especially if you want more than one mailbox. Most popular services are on a pay per-user basis, but MXroute, Mailcheap, Yandex and your own VPS are more on a pay per-storage / resources plan)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think I will split my domains to various services - in that way no government has all of my information and I am more immune to downtimes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/fighting-tinderplusplus-malware/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.m5e.de/post/fighting-tinderplusplus-malware/</guid>
      <description>People who search for love are more vulnerable than happy couples. Especially people who lost their Tinder Account because Tinder has banned them.
There is a malware out there which targets exactly this kind of people. If you search for &amp;ldquo;unban tinder&amp;rdquo; on Google and or YouTube you find many videos and sites which recommend the &amp;ldquo;Tinder++&amp;rdquo; App.
Tinder++ aims to bring you free Tinder Gold and unban your Account. People on sites and videos which recommend the App talk that the Tinder ban is only per Device and they found a way to get around this ban.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;People who search for love are more vulnerable than happy couples. Especially people who lost their Tinder Account because Tinder has banned them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a malware out there which targets exactly this kind of people. If you search for &amp;ldquo;unban tinder&amp;rdquo; on Google and or YouTube you find many videos and sites which recommend the &amp;ldquo;Tinder++&amp;rdquo; App.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinder++ aims to bring you free Tinder Gold and unban your Account. People on sites and videos which recommend the App talk that the Tinder ban is only per Device and they found a way to get around this ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Tinder++ is no App you can get from the Google Play Store or even F-Droid. No! You have to download the App from suspicious sites &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I found this Scheme and I wanted to Stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the kind of people which look at the Header of Spam-Mails and report the sender or linked URLs to the Domain registrar, Hoster, DNS-Provider and Blocklists. Because we live in a civilized world and well known Provider don&amp;rsquo;t wanna host Spammers or other Assholes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-how-did-i-fight-them&#34;&gt;But how did I fight them?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I downloaded the file and uploaded it to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/808a2ac6b6fbf6d0d8cb8b0ab1996faf538b380485955e09ca78a74516790f17/summary&#34;&gt;VirusTotal&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This showed that the file is clearly harmful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I reported the YouTube Videos and made a comment with the VirusTotal Link and a warning about the App&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I checked the Whois Data which gave me the information that the site uses Namecheap as Domain Provider and Cloudflare as DNS-Provider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I reported the Domain to Namecheap and Cloudflare
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Namecheap replied after checking the site that they can do nothing and I need to contact Cloudflare (which I already did)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I created a Hosts-File with the domains and added my Blocklist to my pfBlockerNG instance (so you can&amp;rsquo;t access the malware in my network anymore)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I contacted Tinder and informed them too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sites seems to only show you the APK-File if you visit it via a Android Smartphone, so they seem to check the User-Agent, Resolution or something else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think you would be surprised how many provider really look into SPAM / Malware sites and try to do something. I have written emails about cases like this or simple SPAM cases over Days and the provider I contacted often contacted additional involved provider.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you get a SPAM or phishing mail you should report them because the spammers often use a legal provider in their chain and that provider often is a victim himself (because he is used for illegal activity which puts him in a bad light)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The site seems to do various other scam surveys too: &lt;a href=&#34;https://silzee.com/jailbreak/apphacks/&#34;&gt;https://silzee.com/jailbreak/apphacks/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;current-status&#34;&gt;Current status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing the site which distributes the malware is still out there. I haven&amp;rsquo;t received any notification about the current status from either YouTube or Cloudflare. (And I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t think I get a reply from YouTube - I mean even Woz needed to sue YouTube because they didn&amp;rsquo;t reply to him &amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But please don&amp;rsquo;t get this wrong! Many provider do something if they can prove that there is something illegal going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Head of Trust &amp;amp; Safety at Cloudflare (Justin) reacted to my Tweet but hasn&amp;rsquo;t found &amp;ldquo;definitive proof it&amp;rsquo;s malicious&amp;rdquo;. I hope he looks a little bit closer because I see a site full of scam.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Switching to Hugo</title>

      <description>Moving to Hugo I started this blog as my first blog using a static website generator. Back then I used what everyone else was using: Jekyll.
But Jekyll has it problems. I don&amp;rsquo;t use Ruby for anything else and the management of the dependencies / ruby versions / etc of my static blog was too much for me.
I blog way more often in german on my other WordPress sites and one of the main reasons is that it is easier and Jekyll wasn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as I expected.</description>
      <content>&lt;h2 id=&#34;moving-to-hugo&#34;&gt;Moving to Hugo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this blog as my first blog using a static website generator. Back then I used what everyone else was using: Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jekyll has it problems. I don&amp;rsquo;t use Ruby for anything else and the management of the dependencies / ruby versions / etc of my &lt;strong&gt;static&lt;/strong&gt; blog was too much for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blog way more often in german on my other WordPress sites and one of the main reasons is that it is easier and Jekyll wasn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I switched to Hugo today. Hugo is written in Go and available as a binary - so no more dependencies! Yay! Its also faster! Yay again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I installed a theme which required npm Packages &amp;hellip; So let&amp;rsquo;s see how happy I will be managing this dependencies &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes-about-url-rewrite&#34;&gt;Notes about URL rewrite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are many articles about switching from Hugo to Jekyll out there. Basically the &lt;code&gt;hugo import jekyll jekyll_root_path target_path&lt;/code&gt; command from Hugo converts your posts and then you need to manually edit the config, install a theme and copy your custom pages to &amp;lsquo;content&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing was missing what no other article I found mentioned: What if you want to have the same URL Scheme like Jekyll had in your older posts (so links to them still work) but use the default Hugo URL Scheme for new posts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is possible! You can define custom URLs for each post. My first blog post looks like that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;---
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;date: &amp;#34;2017-02-14T20:03:23Z&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;title: First try of Jekyll
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tags: [jekyll, first, post]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;url: &amp;#34;jekyll/first/post/2017/02/14/first-try-of-jekyll.html&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;---
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you look at the URL of that old post it has the old style from Jekyll but this post about switching to Hugo has the new URL Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Forget Bash, take Python!</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/bash/script/python/linux/2020/05/22/forget-bash-take-python.html</link>

      <description>I wrote bash scripts for several years now. You can find old bash scripts of mine on GitHub but most of them aren&amp;rsquo;t maintained anymore - and I have a reason for that.
But before I give you my reasons for not using many bash scripts anymore, lets look at the benefits of bash:
It super easy and you basically already can it if you write Linux / BSD commands There are frameworks out now which give you advanced features like testing It works out of the box on nearly every Linux / BSD system Okay - sounds good - so what&amp;rsquo;s my problem?</description>

&lt;p&gt;But before I give you my reasons for not using many bash scripts anymore, lets look at the benefits of bash:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It super easy and you basically already can it if you write Linux / BSD commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are frameworks out now which give you advanced features like testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It works out of the box on nearly every Linux / BSD system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay - sounds good - so what&amp;rsquo;s my problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bash is limited. E.g. it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work out of the box in Windows and I switched my default shell in Linux to fish. But let&amp;rsquo;s break down a few points why Bash isn&amp;rsquo;t optimal for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You tend to write platform specific code - e.g. I switched from Debian to Arch Linux and had to replace the &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; commands with &lt;code&gt;pacman&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use fish as default shell. You can use Bash-Scripts with fish, but it&amp;rsquo;s more complicated &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux isn&amp;rsquo;t my only operating system - I run Windows and macOS machines as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love features of higher level programming languages like Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does Python solve this problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It runs out of the box on many Linux systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s cross-platform - the same code can run under Linux, Windows, macOS, &amp;hellip; but you also can check the current system and write platform specific code for that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is also super easy and makes fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing and more advanced features are build in - no need to install packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like bash, it is already used for automating tasks in many systems (so you can find tons of help online)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can simply access the operating system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribution is also very simple - just create a package and pip can install it from the PyPI, private registry or a Git-Repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Languages like Go would also be interesting for automating tasks in your Linux system but Go has things like pointers and types. Python is more similar to Bash - very simple without advanced topics like types or pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created many python scripts for things which solved bash scripts before. And my python scripts all have unit tests and detect the current running operating system. Whereas my bash scripts only worked on Debian systems do my python scripts work on all my used operating systems. So it has saved me a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also continue to use little bash scripts for simple tasks like &amp;ldquo;open this on startup&amp;rdquo; - I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to be aware, that higher level languages like python have a big benefit if you want to switch your system but use the same scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gitea Auto Update Script</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/gitea/update/upgrade/bash/script/2018/11/26/gitea-auto-update-script.html</link>

      <guid>https://blog.m5e.de/gitea/update/upgrade/bash/script/2018/11/26/gitea-auto-update-script.html</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Gitea user for a long time now. Gitea is a nice application to build your own light and fast version of git hosting services like GitHub or GitLab.
Gitea has one problem thought. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t update automatically. A issue for that is open nearly 2 years: https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/518#issuecomment-441742904
If there is one thing that I really hate, it is that a security sensible web application doesn&amp;rsquo;t update automatically. Because of that I have begun to write a update script for Gitea before 4 months.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Gitea user for a long time now. Gitea is a nice application to build your own light and fast version of git hosting services like GitHub or GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gitea has one problem thought. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t update automatically. A issue for that is open nearly 2 years: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/518#issuecomment-441742904&#34;&gt;https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/518#issuecomment-441742904&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing that I really hate, it is that a security sensible web application doesn&amp;rsquo;t update automatically. Because of that I have begun to write a update script for Gitea before 4 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That script has updated my Gitea instance multiple times now and as I can see, that many users have the same problem (a german blog post from me is my most visited article from outside germany), I want to show you my solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;warning&#34;&gt;Warning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned - I am no fan of manual upgrades - because of that I write many auto update scripts for my own systems. This scripts often haven&amp;rsquo;t been tested on other systems and may contain ugly code.
I am open for the creation of issues or pull requests which optimise my code. You should definitely check the code out and make sure to review it before using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some creators - e.g. the person behind Kanboard - have a strong option against auto updates. There are good reasons for that too - you may not want to crash your application because of a faulty upgrade. I recommend auto updates only if you create auto backups, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-script&#34;&gt;The Script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have published the actual version to GitHub: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/CMiksche/gitea-auto-update&#34;&gt;https://github.com/CMiksche/gitea-auto-update&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script was made for a Debian and Arch Linux Systems - I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested it on other systems, but you will definitely encounter errors if you want to use it on Windows, MacOS or a Linux System without systemd (I make bash calls to restart the Gitea service).
You may need to modify the script to work on your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Gitea upgrade changes the template files the automatic update may will destroy your custom design because it is a really simple script and doesn&amp;rsquo;t check that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-use-it&#34;&gt;How to use it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usage of my script is easy (please read the paragraphs over this first - it won&amp;rsquo;t work without modifying it if you have no gitea service or no systemd):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install my script on the system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install gitea-auto-update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a settings.ini file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Gitea]
site=https://your-gitea-instance.com/api/v1/version
apiUrl=https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/releases/latest
system=linux-amd64
file=/usr/local/bin/gitea
tmpDir=/tmp/
buildFromSource=
sourceDir=
logFile=update.log
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the variables in the settings.ini file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the command &lt;code&gt;gite-auto-update --settings=/path/to/settings.ini&lt;/code&gt; in your command line to test the first upgrade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to schedule your updates, edit your &lt;code&gt;/etc/crontab&lt;/code&gt; file and add a call to the script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it. Please write a issue if my script doesn&amp;rsquo;t works. I am caring if people want to use my script ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>After installing FreeBSD to my workstation, I wanted a desktop environment. I&amp;rsquo;ve installed gnome3 after reading the official documentation https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/x11-wm.html.
But nothing has worked. So, I installed the nvidia-driver for my two GPUs. The first documentation I&amp;rsquo;ve found is from &amp;ldquo;7.3-RELEASE&amp;rdquo;: https://docs.freebsd.org/doc/7.3-RELEASE/usr/share/doc/en/articles/compiz-fusion/nvidia-setup.html. (I use 11.1-RELEASE)
Don&amp;rsquo;t use that documentation to make your settings in /boot/loader.conf! There stands:
nvidia_load=&amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; And that&amp;rsquo;s simply not right for the newest driver!
You should enter the following line:</description>

&lt;p&gt;After that and using nvidia-xconfig to create the Xorg-Config file, my system works now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Yesterday I have installed FreeBSD alongside to a existing Windows 10 instance on my Workstation. Today, I want to show you how to do it.
Prerequisites My setup is a SSD with Windows 10 already installed and more than 100 GB free space.
Procedure Install FreeBSD normally (but pay attention to use the free space for FreeBSD during the partitioning).
After the install, you can switch to the shell to take final settings.</description>

      <description>I bought a APU2C4 Board (from the swiss company &amp;ldquo;PC Engines GmbH&amp;rdquo;) and multiple components because I want to build a custom pfSense router.
I&amp;rsquo;ve ordered the device several weeks ago and haven&amp;rsquo;t used it until now. That&amp;rsquo;s because I made a few mistakes (which I want to write now):
First Mistake: I used a power supply with 12V and 2A from china. Visible by: The LED on the back of the device blinks 5 times - then no more again.</description>

&lt;li&gt;Visible by: The LED on the back of the device blinks 5 times - then no more again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solution: Use a 12V and 3A power supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;second&#34;&gt;Second:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mistake: I used a serial cable with Prolific PL2303 Chip and another serial cable with a Gender Changer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visible by: I couldn&amp;rsquo;t connect to the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solution: Don&amp;rsquo;t use PL2303 Chips and Gender Changer! The following Chips are supported: FTDI / FT232RL and Silicon Labs CP2104&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way: The support of pc-engines is really fast - great customer experience &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new serial cable with FT232RL chip hasn&amp;rsquo;t arrived yet. I will write more about that device when i encounter new errors &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve already using different blog systems like WordPress and Ghost, but this is my try to start a blog in english about personal and development topics with Jekyll.
Maybe is the domain not my best choice (.de is the domain for germany), but as I haven&amp;rsquo;t any project on it, I will use it.
I will be using GitHub as hosting service. That will have a few great side effects: you can download my whole blog via git clone, in the same way you could mirror my blog and if you want to notified when a new change happens, you could subscribe my Blog via the &amp;ldquo;Watch&amp;rdquo; Function of GitHub.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t like limits. Because of that, I will only push the &lt;code&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; directory to my GitHub Repo. (In that way I can use custom plugins in Jekyll)&lt;/p&gt;
