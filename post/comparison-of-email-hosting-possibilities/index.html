        <p>I&rsquo;ve hosted my own Mailserver in various configurations since more than 6 years now. Since then I&rsquo;ve taken multiple breaks from hosting it myself and explored other solutions for hosting emails with your own domain names.</p>
<p>Because my own Mailserver has lately problems (downtimes) I wanna explore other possibilities of hosting my email addresses.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="self-hosting-vps-tools-like-mailcow-mailu-etc">Self-hosting (VPS, Tools like Mailcow, Mailu, etc)<a href="#self-hosting-vps-tools-like-mailcow-mailu-etc" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>You simply setup a Mailserver with software like Mailcow, Mailu or Mail-in-a-Box on a virtual Server and manage it yourself.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have the control</li>
<li>Unlimited domains</li>
<li>Unlimited mailboxes</li>
<li>Cheaper than most alternatives if you don&rsquo;t look at the time you need for setup and maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most cheap VPS don&rsquo;t offer a lot of space and if you subtract the OS and installed software, then your space for mail is very limited</li>
<li>You need to invest a lot of time</li>
<li>You need a good spec VPS because Mailserver software and SPAM protection are performance intensive</li>
<li>Small VPS are often targeted by criminals and protection isn&rsquo;t very easy</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;ve done the most of the time.</p>
<p>In the past this was very straightforward if you know how to setup and secure a mailserver but I&rsquo;ve lately problems with things like DDoS and Brute Force Attacks.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24154524">question</a> from me on Hacker News was even so heavily voted that it was for a short time on the front page of HN - so this seems to be a problem for other people too.</p>
<h2 id="pawnmail">Pawnmail<a href="#pawnmail" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>This service doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore but I wanna mention it because it was one of the few free providers where you can get mailboxes for your own domains.</p>
<p>AFAIK that service doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore because it was targeted by spammers and had problems with attacks.</p>
<h2 id="zoho-mail">Zoho Mail<a href="#zoho-mail" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The free plan supports one domain with up to five users and has a 5GB/User and 25MB attachment limit.</p>
<p>Unusable for me because IMAP/ POP/ Active Sync are not included in the free plan.</p>
<p>Indian company, the CEO seems to support Hindu nationalism.</p>
<h2 id="yandex-mail">Yandex Mail<a href="#yandex-mail" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The biggest player in my comparison. Offers 10 GB of storage, up to 1000 users and support for custom domains for free.</p>
<p>It seems like the only problem is that you have to trust a Russian company.</p>
<h2 id="mxroute">MXroute<a href="#mxroute" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Has various plans for custom Domain Email Hosting. All plans include support for unlimited Domains and unlimited Email Accounts.</p>
<p>Especially the Black Friday deals seem to be pretty good every year.</p>
<p>US company, interestingly the Founder has worked for Christian Institutions - so both - the CEOs of Zoho and MXroute seem to be religious persons.</p>
<h2 id="mailcheapco">Mailcheap.co<a href="#mailcheapco" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Cheap Hosting Provider for custom Domain Email, comparable to MXroute but it has more bad reviews than MXroute.</p>
<h2 id="migadu">Migadu<a href="#migadu" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>On the HN Post to this Article <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25201493">someone mentioned</a> Migadu.</p>
<p>Migadu is the only provider on this comparison from Switzerland and the pricing is more expensive compared to the US providers&hellip;</p>
<p>So you pay more but your data is probably also more secure.</p>
<h2 id="postaleio">postale.io<a href="#postaleio" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>French provider, offers a free plan which includes one domain, 2 mailboxes, 3 aliases and 1 GB per mailbox.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Unfortunately it seems like the cheapest hosting possibilities are either trusting a Russian company which government maybe spies on you, trusting a US company which is also obliged to let the government spy on you or to go to an Indian company which is run by a Hindu nationalism supporter&hellip;</p>
<p>Hosting your own server isn&rsquo;t the cheapest option but you are more in control.</p>
<p>I know there are privacy focused providers like ProtonMail or Fastmail out there but the cost of those services are way higher than the providers I mentioned at the time of this writing. (Especially if you want more than one mailbox. Most popular services are on a pay per-user basis, but MXroute, Mailcheap, Yandex and your own VPS are more on a pay per-storage / resources plan)</p>
<p>So I think I will split my domains to various services - in that way no government has all of my information and I am more immune to downtimes.</p>
