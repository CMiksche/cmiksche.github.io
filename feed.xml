You can find old bash scripts of mine on GitHub but most of them aren’t maintained anymore - and i have a reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before i give you my reasons for not using many bash scripts anymore, lets look at the benefits of bash:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It super easy and you basically already can it if you write Linux / BSD commands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are frameworks out now which give you advanced features like testing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It works out of the box on nearly every Linux / BSD system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay - sounds good - so whats my problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bash is limited. E.g. it doesn’t work out of the box in Windows and i switched my default shell in Linux to fish. But let’s break down a few points why Bash isn’t optimal for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You tend to write platform specific code - e.g. i switched from Debian to Arch Linux and had to replace the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; commands with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pacman&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I use fish as default shell. You can use Bash-Scripts with fish, but it’s more complicated …&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linux isn’t my only operating system - i run Windows and macOS machines as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I love features of higher level programming languages like Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how does Python solve this problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It runs out of the box on many Linux systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s cross platform - the same code can run under Linux, Windows, macOS, … but you also can check the current system and write platform specific code for that&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is also super easy and makes fun&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing and more advanced features are build in - no need to install packages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Like bash it is already used for automating tasks in many systems (so you can find tons of help online)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can simply access the operating system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distribution is also very simple - just create a package and pip can install it from the PyPI, private registry or a Git-Repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Languages like Go would also be interesting for automating tasks in your Linux system but Go has things like pointers and types. Python is more similar to Bash - very simple without advanced topics like types or pointers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created many python scripts for things which solved bash scripts before. And my python scripts all have unit tests and detect the current running operating system. Whereas my bash scripts only worked on Debian systems do my python scripts work on all my used operating systems. So it has saved me a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But i also continue to use little bash scripts for simple tasks like “open this on startup” - i think its important to be aware, that higher level languages like python have a big benefit if you want to switch your system but use the same scripts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I wrote bash scripts for several years now.

Gitea is a nice application to build your own light and fast version of git hosting services like GitHub or GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gitea has one problem thought. It doesn’t update automatically. A issue for that is open nearly 2 years: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/518#issuecomment-441742904&quot;&gt;https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/518#issuecomment-441742904&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing that i really hate, it is that a security sensible web application doesn’t update automatically. Because of that i have begun to write a update script for gitea before 4 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That script has updated my gitea instance multiple times now and as i can see, that many users have the same problem (a german blog post from me is my most visited article from outside germany), i want to show you my solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;Warning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As i mentioned - i am no fan of manual upgrades - because of that i write many auto update scripts for my own systems. This scripts often haven’t been tested on other systems and may contain ugly code. 
I am open for the creation of issues or pull requests which optimise my code. You should definitely check the code out and make sure to review it before using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some creators - e.g. the person behind kanboard - have a strong option against auto updates. There are good reasons for that too - you may not want to crash your application because of a faulty upgrade. I recommend auto updates only if you create auto backups, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-script&quot;&gt;The Script&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m developing the script on a private gitea instance - but i don’t wan’t to publish the repository there because i forked from a other private repositiory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of that i have published the actual version to github: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CMiksche/gitea-auto-update&quot;&gt;https://github.com/CMiksche/gitea-auto-update&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script was made for a Debian System - i haven’t tested it on other systems but you will definitely encounter errors if you wan’t to use it on Windows, MacOS or a Linux System without systemd (i make bash calls to restart the gitea service).
You may need to modify the script to work on your system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the gitea upgrade changes the template files the automatic update may will destroy your custom design because it is a really simple script and doesn’t check that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-use-it&quot;&gt;How to use it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usage of my script is easy (please read the paragraphs over this first - it won’t work without modifying it if you have no gitea service or no systemd):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clone my script on the system:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git clone https://github.com/CMiksche/gitea-auto-update.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install requests:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo pip install requests&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the variables in the settings.py file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter the command &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python updater.py&lt;/code&gt; in your commandline to test the first upgrade&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want to schedule your updates, edit your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/crontab&lt;/code&gt; file and add a call the the script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. Please write a issue if my script doesn’t works. I am caring if people want to use my script ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’m a gitea user for a long time now.

I’ve installed gnome3 after reading the official documentation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/x11-wm.html&quot;&gt;https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/x11-wm.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But nothing has worked. So, i installed the nvidia-driver for my two GPUs. The first documentation i’ve found is from “7.3-RELEASE”: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.freebsd.org/doc/7.3-RELEASE/usr/share/doc/en/articles/compiz-fusion/nvidia-setup.html&quot;&gt;https://docs.freebsd.org/doc/7.3-RELEASE/usr/share/doc/en/articles/compiz-fusion/nvidia-setup.html&lt;/a&gt;. (I use 11.1-RELEASE)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t use that documentation to make your settings in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/boot/loader.conf&lt;/code&gt;! There stands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvidia_load=&quot;YES&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s simply not right for the newest driver!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should enter the following line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvidia-modeset_load=&quot;YES&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that and using nvidia-xconfig to create the Xorg-Config file, my system works now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">After installing FreeBSD to my workstation, i wanted a desktop environment.

&lt;p&gt;My setup is a SSD with Windows 10 already installed and more than 100 GB free space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;procedure&quot;&gt;Procedure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install FreeBSD normally (but pay attention to use the free space for freebsd during the partitioning).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the install, you can switch to the shell to take final settings. There you can enter the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;boot0cfg -B ada0

&lt;p&gt;I’ve ordered the device several weeks ago and haven’t used it until now. That’s because i made a few mistakes (which i want to write now):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first&quot;&gt;First&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mistake: I used a power supply with 12V and 2A from china.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visible by: The LED on the back of the device blinks 5 times - then no more again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solution: Use a 12V and 3A power supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;second&quot;&gt;Second:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mistake: I used a serial cable with Prolific PL2303 Chip and another serial cable with a Gender Changer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visible by: I couldn’t connect to the device.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solution: Don’t use PL2303 Chips and Gender Changer! The following Chips are supported: FTDI / FT232RL and Silicon Labs CP2104&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way: The support of pc-engines is really fast - great customer experience …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new serial cable with FT232RL chip hasn’t arrived yet. I will write more about that device when i encounter new errors …&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I bought a APU2C4 Board (from the swiss company “PC Engines GmbH”) and multiple components because i want to build a custom pfSense router.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First try of Jekyll</title><link href="http://blog.m5e.de/jekyll/first/post/2017/02/14/first-try-of-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First try of Jekyll" /><published>2017-02-14T20:03:23+01:00</published><updated>2017-02-14T20:03:23+01:00</updated><id>http://blog.m5e.de/jekyll/first/post/2017/02/14/first-try-of-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.m5e.de/jekyll/first/post/2017/02/14/first-try-of-jekyll.html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve already using different blog systems like WordPress and Ghost, but this is my try to start a blog in english about personal and development topics with Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;
