      <description>Moving to Hugo I started this blog as my first blog using a static website generator. Back then i used what everyone else was using: Jekyll.
But Jekyll has it problems. I don&amp;rsquo;t use Ruby for anything else and the management of the dependencies / ruby versions / etc of my static blog was too much for me.
I blog way more often in german on my other WordPress sites and one of the main reasons is that it is easier and Jekyll wasn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as i expected.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve already using different blog systems like WordPress and Ghost, but this is my try to start a blog in english about personal and development topics with Jekyll.
Maybe is the domain not my best choice (.de is the domain for germany), but as i haven&amp;rsquo;t any project on it, i will use it.
I will be using GitHub as hosting service. That will have a few great side effects: you can download my whole blog via git clone, in the same way you could mirror my blog and if you want to notified when a new change happens, you could subscribe my Blog via the &amp;ldquo;Watch&amp;rdquo; Function of GitHub.</description>
