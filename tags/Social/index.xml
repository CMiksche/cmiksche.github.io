      <description>As a Startup founder, marketing is one of the biggest topics you have to take care of. There are tons of marketing automation tools, and most of them aren&amp;rsquo;t cheap. I found several open source social media management tools, of which some of them are getting used by me for multiple years now.
Socioboard Socioboard is your full-blown social media management tool. It is open source and offers all the features you know from paid tools like Buffer, Hootsuite and others.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;As a Startup founder, marketing is one of the biggest topics you have to take care of. There are tons of marketing automation tools, and most of them aren&amp;rsquo;t cheap.
I found several open source social media management tools, of which some of them are getting used by me for multiple years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;socioboard&#34;&gt;Socioboard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/socioboard/Socioboard-5.0&#34;&gt;Socioboard&lt;/a&gt; is your full-blown social media management tool. It is open source and offers all the features you know from paid tools like Buffer, Hootsuite and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schedule posting, use Content-Libraries, manage multiple accounts, use analytics for checking out your target audience,&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested it yet, and the installation progress is complicated. Besides that, one of the Developers &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/socioboard/Socioboard-5.0/issues/399&#34;&gt;says it is unusable&lt;/a&gt; and created an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vaughngx4/OpenSMM&#34;&gt;alternative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;feed2tweet&#34;&gt;feed2tweet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/chaica/feed2tweet&#34;&gt;feed2tweet&lt;/a&gt; is a small open source python package which allows you to post content from your RSS feed automatically to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use it since multiple years, but I had to fix some issues which aren&amp;rsquo;t merged at the time of writing. So you should better checkout the PR section and maybe install my fork instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;feed2toot&#34;&gt;feed2toot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/chaica/feed2toot&#34;&gt;feed2toot&lt;/a&gt; is from the same author like feed2tweet. It offers posting RSS feed content to Mastodon instead of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the developer merged my PRs and everything should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pod-feeder&#34;&gt;pod-feeder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/brianodonnell/pod_feeder_v2&#34;&gt;pod-feeder&lt;/a&gt; is also an open source tool which makes automatically posting RSS feed content to Diaspora easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure how many people actively use Diaspora, so maybe that&amp;rsquo;s not so important to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;zapier-ifttt-dlvrit&#34;&gt;Zapier, IFTTT, dlvr.it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not open source, but I use the free plan from Zapier for automatically publishing the blog posts from this blog to Medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dlvr.it and IFTTT also offer free plans and can be used for publishing content from an RSS feed to a social media network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some open source tools out there. In combination with free plans from different social media automation companies, you can basically build your social media marketing tool stack for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;feed2tweet, feed2toot and pod-feeder are all written in python. So it should be possible to create one python package for automating the publishing process to Twitter, Mastodon and Diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Recently this talk was given on the rC3 2021 Chaos Communication Congress:
In summary, Florian Gallwitz explained that there are no &amp;ldquo;Social Bots&amp;rdquo; which are often covered in newspapers and magazines.
Newspapers and Journalists create stories about AIs which post about political discussions but in reality these &amp;ldquo;Social Bots&amp;rdquo; are just accounts from human beings which write a lot of social media posts, classified as bots.

      <content>&lt;p&gt;Recently this talk was given on the rC3 2021 Chaos Communication Congress:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Qwiss4qWuTs&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, Florian Gallwitz explained that there are no &amp;ldquo;Social Bots&amp;rdquo; which are often covered in newspapers and magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newspapers and Journalists create stories about AIs which post about political discussions but in reality these &amp;ldquo;Social Bots&amp;rdquo; are just accounts from human beings which write a lot of social media posts, classified as bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real existing &amp;ldquo;bots&amp;rdquo; are dumb systems which e.g. post blog posts on Twitter (I use systems like that for publishing my content across different social media channels) and you feel if you write with a human being or not, because chatbots aren&amp;rsquo;t that evolved yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seem to exist ppl who post propaganda, but these are people, not bots!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes complete sense - if you think about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an AI would be that much evolved, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the inventor of this the richest human being on earth? The biggest companies like Google, Microsoft and Apple are trying to automate as much as possible for years and invent tools like GitHub Copilot so that writing Code can be partially done by AIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For creating an AI which seems to react like a human in different situations, you would need a ton of training, very much computing power and lots of people who train the AI every day. It would cost a ton of money, more than you could imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would you use that for political propaganda in one country if you could basically rule the world? Companies would pay you tons of money because such a system could replace so many people, thus make the company more efficient and more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that newspapers use automated systems for writing news about the stock market or the weather since years, however between writing a simple text and replying to users is a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people unfortunately just read headlines and don&amp;rsquo;t think about it - this is just one of many great talks given on the rC3 2021, there was also a great talk about fairy tales which the west tells itself about Asia (like the Chinese social credit system): &lt;a href=&#34;https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-2021-xhain-354-painting-tech-dystopi&#34;&gt;https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-2021-xhain-354-painting-tech-dystopi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
