      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modern Communists are hard to argue with. Mostly because they say things like &amp;ldquo;There never was a real communist country&amp;rdquo;. So it&amp;rsquo;s hard to take real world examples, because they say countries like the Soviet Union, German Democratic Republic, Cuba or China &amp;ldquo;never were truly communist&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I argue there can never be a &amp;ldquo;truly communist&amp;rdquo; country. Why? Because it is impossible to create that after my opinion. So if you are open for different opinions, then continue reading. I will explain why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Modern Communists are hard to argue with. Mostly because they say things like &amp;ldquo;There never was a real communist country&amp;rdquo;. So it&amp;rsquo;s hard to take real world examples, because they say countries like the Soviet Union, German Democratic Republic, Cuba or China &amp;ldquo;never were truly communist&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I argue there can never be a &amp;ldquo;truly communist&amp;rdquo; country. Why? Because it is impossible to create that after my opinion. So if you are open for different opinions, then continue reading. I will explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;desires-of-humans&#34;&gt;Desires of Humans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can describe the problem with Communism, we have to understand what motivates people and what people desire. That also explains why people are successful in Capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A normal human being has desires like traveling the world, owning a house and, more importantly, be healthy, be able to eat and drink every day, have a family.
All these things need Resources and other people have to work for you (e.g. creating bricks for your house, building the house, planting grains) for fulfilling these dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people also don&amp;rsquo;t want to work hard until they die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dream-world&#34;&gt;Dream World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communists want to live in a nice house, eat good food and drinks, and don&amp;rsquo;t want to work too long. But there is a Problem: Even in the modern world, we don&amp;rsquo;t have the productivity and neither the resources to let everybody own a house, eat great food and be happy every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for fulfilling these dreams, the world actually would need to be more productive, which in turn would mean working harder and longer for everybody. But then, in turn, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have the time to actually enjoy these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-catch&#34;&gt;The Catch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the modern world, if you understand how the system works, you have many ways of earning enough money for fulfilling these dreams. So there is a way for you to have a better life than the average Joe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people who find ways to have a better life than other people are not wanted in a Communist world. So there is a need for a ruling party which enforces the rules and prevents people to gain more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a Communist world can never be a free world for everyone because the people who want to have more are not allowed to do so. That&amp;rsquo;s why all ruling parties in Communist countries are so strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ruling parties, however, have more power than the rest of the Society. So that&amp;rsquo;s basically the paradox of Communism. Communism doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be a two class system, but it has to be because otherwise the basic Idea of Communism can&amp;rsquo;t be enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;human-nature&#34;&gt;Human Nature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, some people who believe in Communism think that they would be in the ruling party. I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. Why? Because the people who are successful in Capitalism are not successful because they love Capitalism so much, no! They are successful because they learn how the System works and do everything which is needed for gaining more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a communist World, these successful Capitalist people would do everything for learning how the systems works and how they can get into the ruling party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after my opinion, most people who believe in Communism today would be victims of the system in a communist World and some people who are successful in Capitalism today would be the Rulers of the Communist System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, after all, this world is neither about Communist nor Capitalist Ideologies. This World is about people who have desires. Some people are ready to do everything for fulfilling these and others just dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anarchism&#34;&gt;Anarchism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people now might come and say Anarchism is somehow connected with Communism, but that&amp;rsquo;s bullshit. When there is no Authority, everybody can do what they want. So some people can just steal things and gain more than others. That&amp;rsquo;s neither Communism nor Capitalism, it&amp;rsquo;s its own kind of System.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Reason why Linux Gaming is so limited</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/the-reason-why-linux-gaming-is-so-limited/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever tried Gaming on a Linux system? Even though Linux exists since more than 30 years now, it is still hard to play a Game on it. Most Games don&amp;rsquo;t even publish a release for Linux. That&amp;rsquo;s why projects like Wine exist (Wine provides a compatibility layer so that Linux Users can play Windows Games)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-it-like-that&#34;&gt;Why is it like that?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that, we need to understand how a Game works and how a Game Developer thinks. Game Developer need to earn money so that they can buy e.g. food. For that, targeting a big Group of Customers is important.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Ever tried Gaming on a Linux system? Even though Linux exists since more than 30 years now, it is still hard to play a Game on it. Most Games don&amp;rsquo;t even publish a release for Linux. That&amp;rsquo;s why projects like Wine exist (Wine provides a compatibility layer so that Linux Users can play Windows Games)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-it-like-that&#34;&gt;Why is it like that?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that, we need to understand how a Game works and how a Game Developer thinks. Game Developer need to earn money so that they can buy e.g. food. For that, targeting a big Group of Customers is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a Game Developer writes a Game, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to write separate Code for every GPU / CPU. In the early days of computing (e.g. the C64 and Atari days), this was the case. Back then, developer wrote code for every different GPU and CPU. This is very time-consuming and if Companies would still act like that, we would have to wait even longer for the e.g. next GTA 6 Game or the next Elder Scrolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Companies like Microsoft and Silicon Graphics came. These companies did something really great for all Game Developers. They provided APIs which can be accessed by one Interface and which handle the different GPUs for you.
This means, a Game Developer only has to write the code once and these APIs handle the rest. Now publishing a Game for different computers is easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This APIs are named DirectX (from Microsoft) and OpenGL. Because DirectX is from Microsoft, the API was only available for Windows. OpenGL on the other hand is available for a wide range of Operating Systems.
OpenGL is also Open Source which means every developer can take a look at the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you can think logical, you already found the reason why Linux Gaming is so limited. The question about the Availability of Games is a Question about which API is more successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people use Windows. Microsoft provides DirectX for Game Development, so most Game Developers choose DirectX as API platform because they can reach most of the people by that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If OpenGL would be more successful, then we would have more Games for Linux because OpenGL is compatible with Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future&#34;&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, Game Developers used OpenGL because they could target Windows, Linux and macOS. Apple however, decided to deprecate OpenGL APIs on all of their platforms because they now have their own proprietary &amp;ldquo;Metal&amp;rdquo; API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many features (like Ray tracing) are only available in these proprietary APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So probably many developers will still choose proprietary APIs like DirectX or Metal in the future because they provide better features which result in better Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason behind this is that companies like Microsoft and Apple want that. They earn way more money that way. Developers have to pay fees and if they use a Windows-only or Apple-only API, then this will result into exclusive titles which are only available on one platform and customers will choose the platform with the better exclusive titles.&lt;/p&gt;
