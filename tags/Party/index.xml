      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, privacy and data protection have become major concerns for both website visitors and developers. With the introduction of GDPR laws, it&amp;rsquo;s important for websites to provide clear information about the sharing of personal data with 3rd party providers. This is where the proposed standard, network.txt, comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-networktxt&#34;&gt;What is network.txt?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/CMiksche/network.txt&#34;&gt;network.txt&lt;/a&gt; is a new standard that provides information about the use of 3rd party providers on a website. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple text file that is both readable by humans and programs alike. The purpose of network.txt is to offer an easy and standard way for visitors to understand which 3rd party providers are being used on a website and where they can find the privacy policy and terms of the website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, privacy and data protection have become major concerns for both website visitors and developers. With the introduction of GDPR laws, it&amp;rsquo;s important for websites to provide clear information about the sharing of personal data with 3rd party providers. This is where the proposed standard, network.txt, comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-networktxt&#34;&gt;What is network.txt?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/CMiksche/network.txt&#34;&gt;network.txt&lt;/a&gt; is a new standard that provides information about the use of 3rd party providers on a website. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple text file that is both readable by humans and programs alike. The purpose of network.txt is to offer an easy and standard way for visitors to understand which 3rd party providers are being used on a website and where they can find the privacy policy and terms of the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-networktxt-work&#34;&gt;How does network.txt work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network.txt file is located in the &lt;code&gt;.well-known&lt;/code&gt; directory and provides a clear list of 3rd party providers used on the website. It also includes a link to the privacy policy and terms of the website. Providers that are necessary for the website to function properly should be listed first, followed by optional providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what a network.txt file might look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# LINKS

Policy: http://www.example.org/Policies/Privacy
Terms: http://www.example.org/Terms

# THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS

Name: Cloudflare
URL: https://www.cloudflare.com
Use: Necessary
For: DDoS protection

Name: Google Analytics
URL: https://analytics.google.com
Use: Optional
For: Analytics
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-networktxt-needed&#34;&gt;Why is network.txt needed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been similar initiatives in the past such as P3P and privacy.txt, but network.txt offers a simpler and more accessible solution for both website visitors and developers. It allows visitors to easily understand which 3rd party providers are being used on a website and where they can find the privacy policy and terms, while also helping developers to create new tools for handling GDPR in a more efficient manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;network.txt is a proposed standard that offers a clear and accessible way for websites to provide information about the use of 3rd party providers and personal data sharing. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple solution that benefits both website visitors and developers, and helps to increase transparency and privacy in the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about it at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/CMiksche/network.txt&#34;&gt;GitHub Repo&lt;/a&gt; of the Standard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cost of Political Party Membership in the EU</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/cost-of-political-party-membership-in-the-eu/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I completely ignored politicians and thought they were unnecessary. Now, I understand they are here to represent the people and try to prevent that different groups inside our society kill each other by defining the rules of how our communities work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am interested to bring my thoughts into this by joining a political party. There are big differences in how much such a membership costs in a country, but even bigger ones when you compare political parties from different countries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now, I understand they are here to represent the people and try to prevent that different groups inside our society kill each other by defining the rules of how our communities work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am interested to bring my thoughts into this by joining a political party. There are big differences in how much such a membership costs in a country, but even bigger ones when you compare political parties from different countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I want to show these differences by comparing different parties inside the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party. We will assume that our possible member earns around 4k per Month and is 27 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Cost per Year&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Germany&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;FDP&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;216 EUR&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Ireland&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Fianna Fáil&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;20 EUR&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Sweden&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Centre Party&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;14,42 EUR (SEK 150)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Spain&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Ciudadanos&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;240 EUR&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Austria&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;NEOS&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;90 EUR&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Estonia&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Estonian Reform Party&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;15 EUR&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;France&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Radical Party&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;25 EUR&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Denmark&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Venstre&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;43.68 EUR (DKK 325)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Netherlands&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;VVD&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;118 EUR*&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Demokratesch Partei&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;25 EUR&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Lithuania&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Liberalų sąjūdis&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;10 EUR&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Italy&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;More Europe&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;50 EUR&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Hungary&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Momentum Mozgalom&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;31.56 EUR (1000 HUF per Month)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Belgium&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Open Vld&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;12.5 EUR&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{*} There is a big difference in the Netherlands for people below or above the age of 27. Below the age of 27, the membership costs are only 35 EUR per year. Also, the first two years only cost 25 EUR per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting: Not many countries make the membership cost dependent on the salary. Here in Germany that is common for all popular parties, but in most of Europe you pay a fixed price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This table doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain all the political parties in the ALDE Party because e.g. it isn&amp;rsquo;t super easy to get the information about the yearly fees from some political parties and I also had problems with translating sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you can definitely see that the cheapest parties (e.g. from Belgium, Lithuania, Estonia and Sweden) only ask for around 12.5 to 15 EUR per year while the most expensive ones in e.g. Germany, Spain and the Netherlands are above 100 and sometimes even above 200 EUR per year.
Most of the parties seem to be in the range between 10 and 90 EUR which is still cheap compared to the costs in my country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am quite sad that German political parties decided to make it expensive for their members to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
