      <title>Influence of Sanctions on Economies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The current &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.m5e.de/post/the-russian-ukrainian-conflict-and-the-stock-market/&#34;&gt;events in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; led to many economic sanctions against Russia. Despite this war is the result of leaders, not their citizens, the West decided to define many very hard sanctions which resulted into making it impossible to trade with Russian Stocks right now. (After the close of the Moscow Exchange, ADRs listed in the US and GDRs listed on the London Stock Exchange also can&amp;rsquo;t be bought anymore)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because many Russian stocks can only be sold right now, the prices for these fell more and more. Speculators who bought some stocks in the beginning of this Week could get these shares very cheap on the few Exchanges and Brokers which still traded them, but now these Speculators also can&amp;rsquo;t trade Russian stocks anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(After the close of the Moscow Exchange, ADRs listed in the US and GDRs listed on the London Stock Exchange also can&amp;rsquo;t be bought anymore)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because many Russian stocks can only be sold right now, the prices for these fell more and more. Speculators who bought some stocks in the beginning of this Week could get these shares very cheap on the few Exchanges and Brokers which still traded them, but now these Speculators also can&amp;rsquo;t trade Russian stocks anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in this blog post I want to answer the question if these dramatic price deductions are in any relation to the various results of sanctions in recent human history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sanctions-against-japan&#34;&gt;Sanctions against Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second world war was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCD_line&#34;&gt;ABCD line&lt;/a&gt; in which America, Britain, China, and the Dutch stopped selling iron ore, steel and oil to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Japan found a way of producing 80% of the Oil which was imported by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sanctions-against-iran&#34;&gt;Sanctions against Iran&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran is the only country which I know of that has faced similar sanctions like Russia currently. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.m5e.de/post/alternatives-to-swift/&#34;&gt;SWIFT-Ban&lt;/a&gt; is nothing new to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinda similar like Japan, Iran started to produce a lot more of which was imported previously by themselves. This seem to be a good strategy. The Iranian Economy actually grew despite the Sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important thing to note here is that western investors don&amp;rsquo;t have a easy way to invest in Iranian stocks. So if Russia would face a similar evolvement, then the Russian economy could grow in a few years above the previous levels, but maybe western shareholders will see nothing of this because the Sanctions make it impossible to invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;statistics&#34;&gt;Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a good article out there from which I quoted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Despite their widespread use on the international stage, economic sanctions are largely ineffective in achieving their objectives [...] between 1915 and 2006, comprehensive sanctions were successful, at best, just 30 percent of the time.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/O5sUbT6VY3&#34;&gt;https://t.co/O5sUbT6VY3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Christoph Miksche (@CMiksche) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CMiksche/status/1499665643246919680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;March 4, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistically and by looking at previous examples we can find out that Capitalism and Economy is stronger than political Sanctions. Most countries can grow economically even when the biggest powers in this world don&amp;rsquo;t like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for foreign Investors, Sanctions can make it very hard and destroy their investment. E.g. in Russia only a few percent of the population use Credit cards, so the impact on companies like Visa and Mastercard is probably bigger then the worries of most Russians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you look from a foreign Investors perspective, then the question is not if Russia will grow again (thats very likely), it is if your country or the Exchanges you use allow you to invest in Russia - that&amp;rsquo;s the bigger Issue for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to note that I am not trying to defend Russia or any other country mentioned here - in all examples there was a good reason to sanction the mentioned countries but from a rational perspective a sanction will most likely improve the local economy so that it is not so vulnerable from outside influences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not investment advice or a buy/sell recommendation. This is my personal opinion and is for information and entertainment purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone acts independently with their financial decision and bears responsibility for it themselves. Trading in securities is always subject to risks and can lead to total loss or debt (e.g. in the case of warrants). Liability is excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Russian-Ukrainian War and the Stock Market</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2008 Russia fought against Georgia in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War&#34;&gt;Russo-Georgian War&lt;/a&gt;. This resulted into a catastrophic situation for the people which live in the areas occupied by Russia. Still today, Russia claims that parts of Georgia are &amp;ldquo;independent&amp;rdquo; Countries which do not belong to Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do I start with this story? It&amp;rsquo;s simply because yesterday Putin officially announced to marsh into Ukraine and basically has the same strategy: he says parts of Ukraine are &amp;ldquo;independent&amp;rdquo; Countries which need to be free from Ukraine. That is basically the same Strategy Putin uses for years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So why do I start with this story? It&amp;rsquo;s simply because yesterday Putin officially announced to marsh into Ukraine and basically has the same strategy: he says parts of Ukraine are &amp;ldquo;independent&amp;rdquo; Countries which need to be free from Ukraine. That is basically the same Strategy Putin uses for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primarily interest here is to find out how it will affect the stock market. The best way to make predictions about the future is to look in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2008 the West (EU and US) were concerned but did nothing because they feared a war. If you look completely rational on that, it would mean that you could use drops in the Russian stock market to invest and make a profit in a few years or months&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However: This time it already resulted in consequences: Germany just froze the Nord Stream 2 Project of Gazprom. It is important to note here that Gazprom made big deals with China in recent years - so that could soften the situation of Gazprom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden wanted to remove Russia from Visa, Mastercard and SWIFT, but he got criticisms and other important ppl said it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be that easy to remove Russia from SWIFT, so currently this is just words without consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have Stocks around the world and think that if the playbook is similar with the Geogrian Situation, then the Russian stock market will drop a little bit for the next few years and then go back to its normal evolvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only real big thing which could change that would be if the West really kicks Russia out of SWIFT, fights Russia and maybe even delists Russian stocks (American Depositary Receipts) on the US Exchanges, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen in 2008, back then the conflict happened with a Bush Administration.
I am not a U.S. politics expert but if a Republican Politician doesn&amp;rsquo;t start a war in a similar situation, why should a Democratic Politician do that? Aren&amp;rsquo;t they usually the ones which gain votes by saying they are against wars?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how should you proceed? If you trade short term, then you can probably get some profit by shortening the Russian stock market. If you invest long term, then you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t think that this will affect Russian companies on the long-term - it didn&amp;rsquo;t in similar situations a few years back so the way international politics work would have to be changed first before it will really have a long-term impact on the Russian stock market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you should think about if it is morally acceptable to invest in Russia. That&amp;rsquo;s probably why Russian stocks were so undervalued over the last years: Ppl didn&amp;rsquo;t want to invest in a country ruled by Putin but on the other side ppl who didn&amp;rsquo;t care about moral aspects could make big returns and profit from high dividend yields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I found out that Russia already has two alternatives to SWIFT: The SPFS &amp;ldquo;System for Transfer of Financial Messages&amp;rdquo; is basically a SWIFT clone from Russia and the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) is the equivalent from China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia is a Cash focused country, so the ban of MasterCard and VISA would probably hurt these American Companies more than the Russian economy. Quote: &amp;ldquo;Approximately ten percent of payment cards issued in Russia were credit cards&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.statista.com/statistics/1099452/credit-card-and-debit-card-number-in-russia/#:~:text=Approximately%20ten%20percent%20of%20payment,250%20million%20of%20these%20cards.&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not investment advice or a buy/sell recommendation. This is my personal opinion and is for information and entertainment purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;
