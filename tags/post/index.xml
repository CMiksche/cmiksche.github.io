      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve already using different blog systems like WordPress and Ghost, but this is my try to start a blog in english about personal and development topics with Jekyll.
Maybe is the domain not my best choice (.de is the domain for germany), but as I haven&amp;rsquo;t any project on it, I will use it.
I will be using GitHub as hosting service. That will have a few great side effects: you can download my whole blog via git clone, in the same way you could mirror my blog and if you want to notified when a new change happens, you could subscribe my Blog via the &amp;ldquo;Watch&amp;rdquo; Function of GitHub.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t like limits. Because of that, I will only push the &lt;code&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; directory to my GitHub Repo. (In that way I can use custom plugins in Jekyll)&lt;/p&gt;
