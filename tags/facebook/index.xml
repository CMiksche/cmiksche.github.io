      <title>The Scapegoat called Meta</title>

      <description>Many people hate Facebook and Instagram. They say it makes us feel bad, is bad for our health, increases the suicide rate of teens and does many more bad things.
But is Meta really all the bad in this world, or is it maybe that Meta just offers a Tool, and it depends how people use it?
I want to shine a light on the later part in this article.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Many people hate Facebook and Instagram. They say it makes us feel bad, is bad for our health, increases the suicide rate of teens and does many more bad things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is Meta really all the bad in this world, or is it maybe that Meta just offers a Tool, and it depends how people use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to shine a light on the later part in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;instagram&#34;&gt;Instagram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about rising suicide rates in teens because of wrong beauty standards, it&amp;rsquo;s not that Meta tells us &amp;ldquo;use Instagram to post pictures of your body, so that other people can rate it&amp;rdquo;. Meta just offers a platform, and it is up to you how you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mostly use Instagram as a backup for my holiday pictures and to share nice places with other people. And that&amp;rsquo;s the thing! The first picture on Instagram was a picture of a Harbor. So the initial thought what Instagram should have been was more near to my usage of it and not to the world-wide beauty competition many teens see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the issues all the people blame Instagram for is nothing created by Instagram themselves but more what the Society made of it. In my eyes, that tells us more what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with our Society and not what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facebook&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again. People blame Facebook because there are many evil and stupid people on Facebook who use it to promote extremist political views and other things bad in our Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook also gets blamed because it &amp;ldquo;doesn&amp;rsquo;t do enough&amp;rdquo; against crime in some countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But put yourself into the position of Mark Zuckerberg. You created a Tool which was meant for people to keep in contact. Now people all over the world use it in languages you don&amp;rsquo;t understand and in Countries where it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even make sense to operate because nearly no companies spend money for advertisement there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very hard to keep up with all the laws and regulations in all the countries in this world. And countries / societies have different views on what is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So forcing a American view on countries in the Middle East could be very dangerous for employees there. Mark Zuckerberg could maybe make some people in the Western world happy, but other people would be so angry that employees may be killed&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the people in the USA / EU want Facebook to be kind of a &amp;ldquo;World Super Police&amp;rdquo;. But Facebook is no government Organisation. Facebook is just a company which sells a tool. Simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision what&amp;rsquo;s right and what&amp;rsquo;s wrong still is the job of governments and the solution to these issues is not Facebook becoming a police, it&amp;rsquo;s more figuring out how Facebook and local governments can work together to create a safer platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a big part of the Issues people have with products from Meta are actually issues of our society, and they use Meta as a Scapegoat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Killing / harming Meta won&amp;rsquo;t make the world a better place because the Issue is in our Society. Instagram-Teens don&amp;rsquo;t have problems with Meta, they have problems because of the wrong beauty standards our Society has. Political problems are nothing new and weren&amp;rsquo;t created by Facebook, but people hate Meta because their products show them these Issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s comparable like hating a weapon company because people die. The weapon company doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually kill the people, but they offer tools which could do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally hate this mentality of hating a Tool instead of actually focusing on the real problem. The real problem in our world aren&amp;rsquo;t the tools, but the people who use them for bad.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Bumble is overvalued</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/why-bumble-is-overvalued/</link>

      <description>Yesterday Bumble had it&amp;rsquo;s initial public offering (IPO). The starting price was 43 USD, a valuation of more than 8 billion and it shot up to 76 USD, a valuation of over 13 billion.
Despite this high valuation, the company lastly made a net loss and only a few hundred million ($376.6 million) in revenue.
The Risk The current market for Tech, EV and Cannabis stocks is in a hype bubble.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Bumble had it&amp;rsquo;s initial public offering (IPO). The starting price was 43 USD, a valuation of more than 8 billion and it shot up to 76 USD, a valuation of over 13 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this high valuation, the company lastly made a net loss and only a few hundred million ($376.6 million) in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-risk&#34;&gt;The Risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current market for Tech, EV and Cannabis stocks is in a hype bubble. I made profit with some overvalued stocks and currently sell these and rebalance my portfolio with more value stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not the only risk. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Dating Apps since multiple months (I also made a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.m5e.de/post/fighting-tinderplusplus-malware/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about a problem with Tinder) and I think the market will evolve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enter-the-world-of-facebook&#34;&gt;Enter the World of Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook launched its own Dating service: Facebook Dating&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this will dominate the market in a few years - why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearly all popular Dating Apps use Facebook Data / Login for registration and validation of the user
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook already has data like Profile Photos, Workplace, Interests,&amp;hellip; which are important in the wold of online dating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook already has methods to validate profiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook already has a bigger user base than all of the dating competition
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To me it seems like the user base of Facebook Dating is already bigger than the user base of Bumble in my local area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered no limits in swipes or other things
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All features which are premium on the competition Apps are free on Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered no Ads in Facebook Dating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess this depends on the individual, but I&amp;rsquo;ve got more matches in a few days on Facebook Dating than in multiple months on Bumble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook promotes social connections - you see who is Friends with other Facebook Friends of you on Facebook
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This adds validation - you trust the other side more that it is not a fake profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should users register with Facebook on Third-Party-Apps if Facebook already provides a superior Dating experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently many people don&amp;rsquo;t know about Facebook Dating, but Facebook is a Advertising Platform with a giant user base - so it should be very easy to gain more and more people until the competition dies out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like the Investors in Bumble aren&amp;rsquo;t aware that this big competitor is out there and the IPO money was needed for Bumble to have a chance fighting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not investment advice or a buy/sell recommendation. This is my personal opinion and is for information and entertainment purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone acts independently with their financial decision and bears responsibility for it themselves. Trading in securities is always subject to risks and can lead to total loss or debt (e.g. in the case of warrants). Liability is excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
